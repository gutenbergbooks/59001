<p>(<i>Continued.</i>)</p>

<p>The frontispiece we are enabled to give this month is penned in
what may be termed pictorial hieroglyphics by Sir Edwin Landseer. The
letter was addressed to Charles George Lewis, the celebrated engraver.
The first house represented is Lewis's residence in Charlotte-street,
whilst the final sketch is a very correct drawing of the artist's house
in St. John's Wood-road. It remains just in the same state to-day, and
is occupied by Mr. H. W. B. Davis, R.A. This delightfully original
missive reads&mdash;evidently in response to an invitation:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/scan335-2.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">WOBURN ABBEY. 1826<br />

A SPORTSMAN'S CARD, BY SIR EDWIN LANDSEER.</p></div>
</div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Charles</span>,&mdash;I shall be delighted
to come to your house, also Maria, William,
and Henry.&mdash;Yours, <span class="smcap">Neddy Landseer</span>."</p>

<p>The only other occasion on which Landseer departed from his usual
routine of work seems to have been when he was on a visit to the
Duke of Bedford at Woburn Abbey, in December, 1826, at which time
the artist was in his twenty-third year. He set himself to sketch a
couple of sportsman's cards, of which we give the one considered the
most picturesque, and best calculated to show the great painter's
versatility and ingenuity. The writing is that of the Duke of Bedford,
and, to judge by the number of hares, rabbits, and pheasants bagged,
sport at Woburn Abbey during this particular week must have been fairly
brisk. There is no question as to the genuine nature of this veritable
curiosity, for on the back of it is written the signature&mdash;in ink
almost faded&mdash;of Lady Georgiana Russell.</p>

<p>From our remarks in the previous chapter on "Pictures with
Histories," it will be readily gathered that behind nearly every
canvas which Landseer touched some happy incident lies hidden away.
His magnificent work, "A Distinguished Member of the Humane Society,"
was suggested to him by seeing the noble creature which figures in the
picture carrying a basket of flowers in its mouth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span></p>

<p>"Lion"&mdash;a picture he painted for Mr. W. H. Merle for
&#163;50&mdash;has its story to tell. Landseer particularly wished to see
the dog&mdash;Lion&mdash;excited. There chanced to be in the house a
live mouse in a trap. The mouse was let loose, Lion gave chase, and
the next instant the mouse had disappeared. There was no accounting
for such a rapid exit, when somebody suggested that possibly Lion had
swallowed it. And such was the fact; the poor little mouse had found
safety in the dog's huge jowls. Immediately Lion's lips were opened the
tiny creature jumped out uninjured and made good its escape.</p>

<p>Lion, being a particularly powerful dog, was not easy to play tricks
with. On one occasion whilst he was walking along the bank of a canal,
a passing bargeman began to poke him with his oar. With a sudden rush
and a jerk, Lion seized the oar, and lifted his tormentor into the
water. It is interesting to note that Lion's portrait was despatched in
a heavy case to Paris, just at the time of the Revolution, and narrowly
escaped being used as a barricade.</p>

<p>Here is another anecdote of one of Landseer's pictures. "Beauty's
Bath" was a portrait of Miss Eliza Peel, daughter of Sir Robert Peel,
in which she is shown with a pretty little pet poodle, named Fido,
in her arms. At the time the picture was engraved and about to be
issued to the public, Sir Robert was not on the best of terms with the
populace. This the publisher knew, and saw that, if he issued the work
as "a portrait of Miss Peel," it would ruin the sale. Accordingly,
he gave it this very taking title, by which it has ever since been
known.</p>

<p>One day Sir Robert met the publisher and demanded why the title
had been changed. He was assured that "Beauty's Bath" was most
appropriate.</p>

<p>"Oh! yes, that's all right," said Sir Robert. "I've no objection
to that. Only," he continued thoughtfully, evidently thinking of the
pet poodle and his charming daughter, "which do you intend for the
beauty?"</p>

<p>"Well," replied the publisher merrily, "you pay your money and you
take your choice!"</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/scan336.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">HUNTSMAN AND HOUNDS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Landseer loved to have his artistic joke.
This is excellently seen in the two sketches
which we reproduce. "Huntsman and
Hounds" is a little pen-and-ink drawing
done for Miss Wardrop at the age of
thirty-four. Miss Wardrop, herself, was fond
of the pencil and brush, and was particularly
partial to animals. She found no
small difficulty in drawing accurately a
horse's hoofs. One day she went to Landseer
and told him frankly of her non-success,
at the same time asking him to give
her a hint as to the best way of drawing
them correctly. The artist good-humouredly
complied with her request, and showed
her that it was by no means necessary
to depict them at all. This he did by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
hiding the horse's hoofs in a wealth of grass,
as shown in the sketch.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/scan337.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">"THE EXPECTANT DOG."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"The Expectant Dog" is another example
of the artist's merry moments. The
poodle was the property of the Hon. F.
Byng, a distinguished member of the
Humane Society, and also prominent
through his connection with the Metropolitan
Commission of Sewers. Landseer
was dining with Mr. Byng, when he was
asked to make a little sketch of Mr. Byng
himself. This he immediately did by
drawing that gentleman's favourite dog
with its head up a sewer in the midst of
a puddle of water, and a rat making a
very speedy exit at its approach. The
eminent Commissioner of Sewers saw the
joke at once, as did also his friends, and
for many a long day he was known by the
nickname of "Poodle Byng."</p>

<p>We now turn to some works by Sir
Joshua Reynolds, to which a history is
attached, and, in so doing, there occurs a
somewhat curious incident, which has the
interest of connecting two of our greatest
painters. Sir Joshua's famous picture
of "The Gleaners" shows one of the
toilers of the field carrying a bundle of
wheat on her head. This figure was
put in, as the lady&mdash;Miss Potts&mdash;who posed
as the model for it, happened to be staying
with her friends, the Macklins, where Sir
Joshua was staying also. Miss Potts was
destined to become the mother of Sir
Edwin Landseer; for, some time afterwards,
she met John Landseer, loved and married
him. In passing, it may be mentioned
that Sir Joshua is credited with having expressed
the opinion that if an artist painted
four or five distinctly original subjects in
his lifetime, the achievement should be sufficient
to satisfy the demands of the expectant
public. Hence he painted no fewer than a
quartette of "The Strawberry Girl," each
single picture being as good as the others,
though probably the first one painted would
be preferred for choice. Any of them
would easily fetch &#163;2,000 or &#163;3,000 each.
We have had the privilege of examining
Sir Joshua's own ledgers, and in 1766 we
find that he was only receiving &#163;150 for a
whole length portrait, &#163;70 for half-length,
&#163;50 for a kit cat (36 in. × 25 in.), and
&#163;30 for a head. Gainsborough received
about the same figure.</p>

<p>The recent tragic death of the Duke of
Bedford suggests to us a picture which Sir
Joshua painted of "The Bedford Family"&mdash;a
work worth, at the lowest estimate,
&#163;10,000. The curious circumstance of
allowing this valuable painting to be turned
towards the wall in a darkened room for a
great number of years is in itself suggestive
of some unknown story. At last it was
decided to have the picture renovated, for
it had become perfectly black. It was
accordingly sent to be cleaned; but it
was found impossible to remove the dire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
results which a darkened room and a dusty
atmosphere had worked upon it. It was then
suggested that the very opposite means
should be tried. The canvas was hung in
a room, the roof of which was of glass,
through which the bright sunshine could
fall upon it. As the week and month
passed by, the sunlight scattered the
gloom by degrees, until, at the end of a
year, all had disappeared, and the rich
colouring was once more visible. One of
the boys represented in the picture is Lord
William Russell&mdash;the father of the late
Duke of Bedford&mdash;who was killed by his
valet in 1840.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/scan338.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">"THE BEDFORD FAMILY."</p></div>
</div>

<p>A "Sir Joshua" worth &#163;15,000 has been
thrown out of window during a fire, and
reached the ground untouched by smoke or
flame. This was "Lady Williams Wynn
and children," which now hangs at Wynstay.
A very interesting incident may be told
to show how minute Sir Joshua was&mdash;even
to a hair. At the sale of his books, there
was found amongst the leaves a little curl
wrapped up in a small piece of tissue paper
on which the artist had written "Lady
Waldegrave's hair." He had painted a
picture of the Countess of Waldegrave and
her daughter, and, in order to get the exact
colour of the hair, had persuaded the
Countess to cut off a lock. It was recently
beautifully mounted, surrounded by portraits
of the pictures connected with it,
and presented to the late Countess; and it
now hangs underneath the original work.</p>

<p>Can a leopard change its spots? Yes, so
far as a pictorial leopard goes&mdash;as may be
illustrated by a painting by Sir Joshua of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
Master Herbert as a Bacchus. He made an
error here, for he depicted the god of wine
surrounded by lionesses, when, of course,
leopards should have figured in the festive
scene. The engraver in whose hands the
picture was placed saw the mistake, and
took it upon himself to add the spots to the
lionesses, thereby converting them into
leopards in his engraving. He even went
further, and painted the necessary spots on
the animals on the canvas. One hundred
years passed away, and the picture was sent
to London to be cleaned and restored, when,
to the great dismay of the cleaner, he
noticed that as he worked the leopards
began to lose their spots! Examination
soon showed what was the reason. All
the spots were removed,
the lionesses appeared in
their proper skins, and so the
picture now appears.</p>

<p>We reproduce two pictures
by Sir Joshua Reynolds. The
history of one is as sensational
as the other is broadly
humorous. They happen,
too, to be the stories of a
husband and wife.</p>

<div class="figright" >
<img src="images/scan339.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">MRS. MUSTERS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Musters was a great
beauty of her day, and in
1778 Sir Joshua painted her.
The picture he sent home to
Mr. Musters to his seat at Colwick.
An application was received
from the artist that the
canvas should be returned to
him, as he desired to make
one or two important alterations
which would considerably
benefit the picture. It
was sent back to him, and
it remained in his possession
seven years. Time after time
it was applied for, but all
to no effect&mdash;it was impossible
to get it back; the
applicants got nothing but
excuse after excuse. At last,
in desperation, Sir Joshua
declared that he had spoiled
the work, and so destroyed it,
and to make up for this he
painted another of Mrs.
Musters in the character of
Hebe, after a lapse of seven
years. Where was the
original picture? It transpired
that George IV.&mdash;then
Prince of Wales&mdash;was at that
time engaged in making a collection of
the beauties of his Court, and had often
asked Mr. Musters to allow his wife to
sit for her portrait for this purpose. This
Mr. Musters firmly refused. The Prince
then brought some pressure to bear on
Sir Joshua Reynolds to get the picture.
How Sir Joshua set to work has already
been seen. The painting was afterwards sold
at the Pavilion at Brighton, and was purchased
by the Earl of Egremont of Petworth,
at whose seat it now hangs. It
should be mentioned that this is the only
instance on record where Sir Joshua did
anything to cast a shade upon a character
which was in every other respect a
truly honourable one. The pressure which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
the Prince enforced was too great, and he
succumbed.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/scan340.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">JOHN MUSTERS, ESQ.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Surely nothing can be more humorous
than the fact of a man having his
portrait painted, and, as the fashion
in clothing changed, so having the latest
thing in satin coat and flowered vest put
on his figure! Yet this was actually done,
and by the husband of the very lady who
figures prominently in the preceding story.
Mr. Musters was exceptionally eccentric.
Not content with a picture of himself by Sir
Joshua, he secured from time to time the
services of another artist to re-clothe him
up to date. Some years after his death, the
canvas was submitted to a well-known
expert, when the momentous question
arose as to how it could possibly be a
genuine Sir Joshua when the clothing was
of a date some thirty years after the great
artist had ceased to exist? The picture was
put into the hands of a cleaner, when he,
almost bewildered, sent a hasty message to
the expert to say that all the clothes were
gradually coming off! Part of the coat
had disappeared, the flowers on the vest
were fading, the fob of the watch-chain had
gone. The whole truth was soon made
evident, and very soon the old, though
valuable, clothes were all found underneath,
and Mr. Musters appeared in the proper
costume of his day as Sir Joshua painted
him. As such he is to be seen in our
copy of the engraving from the picture.</p>

<p>The works of Gainsborough
are replete with anecdote.
One incident is worthy of
being chronicled as associating
Sir Joshua Reynolds
and this great artist together.
It happened in 1782, when
the two painters, to put it
plainly, were not on speaking
terms. At the Royal Academy
of that year Gainsborough
exhibited a picture,
"Girl and Pigs." Sir Joshua
was much impressed with it,
and, as a token of his appreciation
of unquestionable
genius, and, we venture to
think, possibly with a view
to bringing about a renewal
of friendship, purchased the
work for &#163;100. It would
bring thousands now. The
Earl of Carlisle possesses it.</p>

<p>Gainsborough was generous
to a high degree. When
he was at Bath he was
anxious to paint Quin, the
actor, and in return for the
sitting said that he would
make him a present of the
portrait. Quin refused. Gainsborough
pleaded with him,
and made use of these remarkable
words: "If you
will let me paint your portrait
<i>I shall live for ever!</i>"
The actor gave way, but today
the picture preserves the
memory of Quin. On one
occasion Gainsborough actually
gave half-a-dozen
pictures to a Mr. Wiltshire, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
carrier, who, "solely for the love of art,"
volunteered to convey one of his important
canvases to London free of charge.
These pictures were the price paid for
the van hire, and two of them now hang
in the National Gallery&mdash;"The Market
Cart," and "The Parish Clerk."</p>

<p>The two next reproductions we give
have exceptionally singular histories. One
indeed is a romance of the purest type.
The fact of his celebrated Duchess of
Devonshire having
been stolen
has probably had
much to do with
making the public
regard it as the
finest thing that
Gainsborough
ever did. But
art connoisseurs
say that the
"Hon. Mrs. Graham"
is a far
finer bit of colouring.
It now
hangs in the
National Gallery
of Scotland, and
its value is put
down at &#163;25,000.
Here is its history&mdash;a
truly romantic
one.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/scan341.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE HONOURABLE MRS. GRAHAM.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Graham
was the wife of
Captain Graham,
who years afterwards
became
General Lord
Lynedoch, G.C.B.
She was only
seventeen when
her husband commissioned
Gainsborough
to paint
her. He was
passionately attached
to his
beautiful wife,
their married life was one long day of
happiness, and when, at a comparatively
early age, she died, her broken-hearted
husband could not bear even
to look upon the picture, and it disappeared.
He tried in every way to put an
end to his life honourably; but at all times
failed. He went into the Peninsular War,
volunteered for every "forlorn hope" in
the hope of getting killed; but he seemed
to bear a charmed life, and rose to be a
Field Marshal in the English Army,
and lived to ninety-one years of age.
Where was the picture of such fabulous
value? It was not until after Lord Lynedoch's
death that it was discovered in a
furniture warehouse, where it had been
packed away in a heavy case and concealed
from view for very many years.</p>

<p>We now come to the picture that was the
means of bringing
about the
historical quarrel
between Gainsborough
and the
Royal Academy;
and, in order
that its history
should be fully
set forth in these
pages, the writer
has searched the
various newspapers
of that
day with a view
of showing the
extreme feeling
that existed.
Gainsborough
sent a picture of
the three daughters
of George
III. to the Academy,
with a
polite request
that it should be
hung the same
distance from the
ground as it
would be when
placed in position
in the Royal residence.
The Academy
Council ignored
this wish,
and hung it far
too high. This so
enraged Gainsborough&mdash;who
was of a somewhat irritable disposition&mdash;that
he sent for all his pictures, and had
them brought back from the Academy. <i>The
Morning Herald</i> of May 5, 1784, says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yesterday, the three pictures of the
Princess Royal, Princess Elizabeth, and
Princess Augusta were removed from the
Exhibition Room of Somerset House on
the Strand to Mr. Gainsborough's at Pall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
Mall, and from thence are to be fixed as
furniture at Carlton House."</p>

<p><i>The Morning Herald</i> was, however,
wrong, there was only one picture, not three.</p>

<p>Again, the following extract, which
appeared in the same paper on May 7,
1784, is worthy of being quoted:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Gainsborough, whose professional absence
every visitor of the Royal Academy
so feelingly deplores, is fitting up his own
saloon in Pall Mall for the display of his
matchless productions, where he may safely
exhibit them without further offence to the
Sons of Envy and Dullness.... By the
bye, let it be remembered to the honour of
Sir Joshua Reynolds and Sir William
Chambers, that, so far from abetting the
conduct of the Academy Hangmen, they
have in the handsomest manner protested
against the shameful outrage offered by
these fatal executioners to genius and taste!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/scan342.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">PRINCESS ROYAL, PRINCESS AUGUSTA, AND PRINCESS ELIZABETH: DAUGHTERS OF GEORGE III.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The history of the picture does not end
here. It remained at Carlton House until
the building was pulled down, and was
then removed to Buckingham Palace. At
some subsequent period an unknown individual
requiring a picture to fit in a space
over a door to one of the State Rooms,
positively had it cut down to the required
size. It is still there. Its value at the
present moment, had it been left untouched,
would be &#163;20,000; as it is, it is worth
about half that sum. Our illustration
shows the painting as it is to-day.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">From the French of Guy de Maupassant.</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Henri R&#233;n&#233; Albert Guy de Maupassant</span> was born on the 5th of August in the year 1850. His
parents lived in Normandy, and were people of position; but when, in 1870, the war broke out with Prussia,
Guy, then just twenty, buckled on his sword and served his country as a common soldier. When the war was
over, he became acquainted with Gustave Flaubert, and the brilliant author of "Salammb&#244;" introduced him
to the world of letters, in which he quickly won himself a foremost place. He is not a very prolific writer,
but the quality of his work is always fine, and he is one of the best writers of short tales now living. He is
fond of using his experience of the war as a basis for his stories&mdash;of which "Two Fishers" is an excellent
example, as well as of his remarkably artistic style, which tells a story in its full effect without a word too
much or little.</p></blockquote>

<p class="a">aris was blockaded&mdash;famished&mdash;at
the point of death.
Even the sparrows on the
housetops were few and far
between, and the very sewers
were in danger of becoming
depopulated. People ate anything they
could get.</p>

<p>Monsieur Morisot, watchmaker by trade,
was walking early one bright January morning
down the Boulevards, his hands in
the pockets of his overcoat, feeling hungry
and depressed, when he unexpectedly ran
against a friend. He recognised Monsieur
Sauvage, an old time chum of the river-side.</p>

<p>Every Sunday before the war Morisot
used to start at daybreak with his bamboo
fishing rod in his hand, his tin bait and
tackle box upon his back. He used to take
the train to Colombes, and to walk from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
there to the Island of Maranthe. No
sooner had he arrived at the river than he
used to begin to fish and continue fishing
until evening. Here every Sunday he
used to meet Monsieur Sauvage, a linen-draper
from Paris, but stout and jovial
withal, as keen a fisherman moreover as he
was himself.</p>

<p>Often they would sit side by side, their
feet dangling over the water for half a day
at a time and say scarcely a word, yet little
by little they became friends. Sometimes
they never spoke at all. Occasionally they
launched out into conversation, but they
understood each other perfectly without its
aid, for their tastes and ideas were the same.</p>

<p>On a spring morning in the bright sunshine,
when the light and delicate mist
hovered over the river, and these two mad
fishermen enjoyed a foretaste of real
summer weather, Morisot would say to his
neighbour: "Hein! not bad, eh?"</p>

<p>And Sauvage would reply: "I know
nothing to beat it."</p>

<p>This interchange of sentiments was quite
enough to engender mutual understanding
and esteem.</p>

<p>In autumn, toward evening, when the
setting sun reddened the sky
and cast shadows of the
fleeting clouds over the
water; when the river was
decked in purple; when the
whole horizon was lighted
up and the figures of the two
friends were illumined as
with fire; when the russet-brown
of the trees was lightly
tinged with gold, and the
trees themselves shivered
with a wintry shake, Monsieur
Sauvage would smile at
Monsieur Morisot and say,
"What a sight, eh?"</p>

<p>And Monsieur Morisot,
without even raising his eyes
from his float would answer,
"Better than the Boulevards,
hein!"</p>

<p>This morning, as soon as
they had recognised each
other they shook hands
warmly, quite overcome at meeting again
under such different circumstances.</p>

<p>Monsieur Sauvage sighed and murmured,
"A nice state of things."</p>

<p>Monsieur Morisot, gloomy and sad,
answered, "And what weather! To-day is
New Year's day." The sky in fact was
clear, bright, and beautiful.</p>

<p>They began to walk along, sorrowful
and pensive. Said Morisot, "And our
fishing, eh? What times we used to
have!"</p>

<p>Sauvage replied, "When shall we have
them again?"</p>

<p>They went into a little "caf&#233;" and had
a glass of absinthe, and then started again
on their walk.</p>

<p>They stopped at another "caf&#233;" for
another glass. When they came out again
they were slightly dazed, like people who
had fasted long and then partaken too
freely.</p>

<p>It was lovely weather; a soft breeze
fanned their faces. Monsieur Sauvage,
upon whom the fresh air was beginning to
take effect, suddenly said: "Suppose we
were to go!"</p>

<p>"Go where?"</p>

<p>"Why, fishing!"</p>

<p>"But where?"</p>

<p>"To our island, of course. The French
outposts are at Colombes. I know
Colonel Dumoulin; he will let us pass
through easily enough."</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/scan344.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">"THEY WENT ON THEIR WAY REJOICING."</p></div>
</div>

<p>Morisot trembled with delight at the
very idea: "All right, I'm your man."</p>

<p>They separated to fetch their rods.</p>

<p>An hour afterwards they were walking
fast along the high-road, towards the
town commanded by Colonel Dumoulin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
He smiled at their request but granted it,
and they went on their way rejoicing in the
possession of the password.</p>

<p>Soon they had crossed the lines, passed
through deserted Colombes, and found themselves
in the vineyard leading down to the
river. It was about eleven o'clock.</p>

<p>On the other side the village of
Argenteuil seemed as if it were dead. The
hills of Orgremont and Saumons commanded
the whole country round. The great
plain stretching out as far as Nanterne was
empty as air. Nothing in sight but cherry
trees, and stretches of grey soil.</p>

<p>Monsieur Sauvage pointed with his
finger to the heights above and said, "The
Prussians are up there," and a vague sense
of uneasiness seized upon the two friends.</p>

<p>The Prussians! They had never set eyes
upon them, but for months past they had
felt their presence near, encircling their
beloved Paris, ruining their beloved France,
pillaging, massacring, insatiable, invincible,
invisible, all-powerful, and as they thought
on them a sort of superstitious terror
seemed to mingle with the hate they bore
towards their unknown conquerors.
Morisot murmured, "Suppose we were to
meet them," and Sauvage replied, with the
instinctive gallantry of the Parisian,
"Well! we would offer them some of
our fish for supper."</p>

<p>All the same they hesitated before
venturing into the country, intimidated as
they were by the all-pervading silence.</p>

<p>Eventually Monsieur Sauvage plucked up
courage: "Come along, let's make a start;
but we must be cautious."</p>

<p>They went through the vineyard, bent
double, crawling along from bush to bush,
ears and eyes upon the alert.</p>

<p>Only one strip of ground lay between
them and the river. They began to run,
and when they reached the bank they
crouched down among the dry reeds for
shelter.</p>

<p>Morisot laid his ear to the ground to
listen for the sound of footsteps, but he
could hear nothing. They were alone,
quite alone; gradually they felt reassured
and began to fish.</p>

<p>The deserted island of Maranthe hid them
from the opposite shore. The little
restaurant was closed, and looked as if it
had been neglected for years.</p>

<p>Monsieur Sauvage caught the first gudgeon,
Monsieur Morisot the second. And
every minute they pulled up their lines
with a little silver object dangling and
struggling on the hook. Truly, a miraculous
draught of fishes. As the fish were caught
they put them in a net which floated
in the water at their feet. They positively
revelled in enjoyment of a long-forbidden
sport. The sun shone warm upon their
backs. They heard nothing&mdash;they thought
of nothing&mdash;the rest of the world was
as nothing to them. They simply fished.</p>

<p>Suddenly a smothered sound, as it were
underground, made the earth tremble. The
guns had recommenced firing. Morisot
turned his head, and saw above the bank,
far away to the left, the vast shadow of
Mont Valerien, and over it the white wreath
of smoke from the gun which had
just been fired. Then a jet of flame burst
forth from the fortress in answer, a
moment later followed by another explosion.
Then others, till every second as it seemed
the mountain breathed out death, and the
white smoke formed a funeral pall above it.</p>

<p>Monsieur Sauvage shrugged his shoulders.
"They are beginning again," he said.</p>

<p>Monsieur Morisot, anxiously watching
his float bob up and down, was suddenly
seized with rage against the belligerents
and growled out: "How idiotic to kill one
another like that."</p>

<p>Monsieur Sauvage: "It's worse than the
brute beasts."</p>

<p>Monsieur Morisot, who had just hooked a
bleak, said: "And to think that it will
always be thus so long as there are such
things as Governments."</p>

<p>Monsieur Sauvage stopped him: "The
Republic would not have declared war."</p>

<p>Monsieur Morisot in his turn: "With
Kings we have foreign wars, with the
Republic we have civil wars."</p>

<p>Then in a friendly way they began to
discuss politics with the calm common-sense
of reasonable and peace-loving men,
agreeing on the one point that no one
would ever be free. And Mont Valerien
thundered unceasingly, demolishing with
its cannon-balls French houses, crushing out
French lives, ruining many a dream, many
a joy, many a hope deferred, wrecking
much happiness, and bringing to the hearts
of women, girls, and mothers in France
and elsewhere, sorrow and suffering which
would never have an end.</p>

<p>"It's life," said Monsieur Morisot.</p>

<p>"Say rather that it's death," said Monsieur
Sauvage.</p>

<p>They started, scared out of their lives, as they
felt that someone was walking close
behind them. Turning round, they saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
four men, four tall, bearded men, dressed as
servants in livery, and wearing flat caps
upon their heads. These men were covering
the two fishermen with rifles.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/scan346.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">"TURNING ROUND THEY SAW FOUR MEN."</p></div>
</div>

<p>The rods dropped from their frightened
hands, and floated aimlessly down the river.
In an instant the Frenchmen were seized,
bound, thrown into a boat, and ferried over
to the island.</p>

<p>Behind the house they had thought uninhabited
was a picket of Prussian soldiers.
A hairy giant, who was sitting astride a
chair, and smoking a porcelain pipe, asked
them in excellent French if they had had
good sport.</p>

<p>A soldier placed at the feet of the officer
the net full of fish, which he had brought
away with him.</p>

<p>"Not bad, I see. But we have other fish
to fry. Listen, and don't alarm yourselves.
You are a couple of French spies sent out
to watch my movements, disguised as
fishermen. I take you prisoners, and I order
you to be shot. You have fallen into my
hands&mdash;so much the worse for you. It is
the fortune of war. Inasmuch, however,
as you came through the lines you are
certainly in possession of the password.
Otherwise you could not get back again.
Give me the word and I will let you go."</p>

<p>The two friends, livid with fear, stood
side by side, their hands nervously twitching,
but they answered not a word.</p>

<p>The officer continued: "No one need
ever know it. You will go home quietly,
and your secret will go with you. If you
refuse it is death for you both, and that
instantly. Take your choice."</p>

<p>They neither spoke nor moved.</p>

<p>The Prussian calmly pointed to the river
and said: "Reflect, in five minutes you will
be at the bottom of that water. I suppose
you have families."</p>

<p>Mont Valerien thundered unceasingly.</p>

<p>The two Frenchmen stood perfectly still
and silent.</p>

<p>The officer gave an order in German.
Then he moved his chair farther away
from the prisoners, and a dozen soldiers
drew up in line twenty paces off.</p>

<p>"I will give you one minute," he said,
"not one second more."</p>

<p>He got up leisurely, and approached the
two Frenchmen. He took Morisot by the
arm and said, in an undertone: "Quick!
Give me the word. Your friend will
know nothing. I will appear to give way."</p>

<p>Monsieur Morisot did not answer.</p>

<p>The Prussian took Monsieur Sauvage
aside and said the same thing to him.</p>

<p>Monsieur Sauvage did not answer.</p>

<p>They found themselves once more side
by side.</p>

<p>The officer gave another order; the
soldiers raised their guns.</p>

<p>By accident Morisot's glance fell upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
the net full of fish on the ground a few
steps off. A ray of sunshine lit up their
glittering bodies, and a sudden weakness
came over him. "Good-bye, Monsieur
Sauvage," he whispered.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Monsieur Morisot," replied
Monsieur Sauvage. They pressed each
other's hands, trembling from head to foot.</p>

<p>"Fire," said the officer.</p>

<p>Monsieur Sauvage fell dead on his face.
Monsieur Morisot, of stronger build, staggered,
stumbled, and then fell right across
the body of his friend, with his face turned
upwards to the sky, his breast riddled with
balls.</p>

<p>The Prussian gave another order. His
men dispersed for a moment, returning with
cords and stones. They tied the stones to
the feet of the dead Frenchmen, and carried
them down to the river.</p>

<p>Mont Valerien thundered unceasingly.</p>

<p>Two soldiers took Morisot by the head
and feet. Two others did the same to
Sauvage. The bodies swung to and fro,
were launched into space, described a curve,
and plunged feet first into the river.</p>

<p>The water bubbled, boiled, then calmed
down, and the little wavelets, tinged with
red, circled gently towards the bank.</p>

<p>The officer, impassive as ever, said, "It
is the fishes' turn now."</p>

<p>His eye fell upon the gudgeon lying on
the grass. He picked them up, and called
out, "Wilhelm." A soldier in a white
cap appeared. He threw the fish towards
him.</p>

<p>"Fry these little animals for me at once,
while they are still alive and kicking. They
will be delicious."</p>

<p>Then he began smoking again.</p>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/scan348.jpg" alt="T" class="cap" />
</div>

<p class="a">T is what a simple young
writer once called "a beautiful
truism" that baby is one
of oldest subjects in the
world&mdash;indeed, it is almost as
old as man&mdash;and yet it has
seldom or never been treated with completeness.
No doubt one reason for that is the
fact that baby has never been able to make
itself heard except in inarticulate cries, and
no doubt also another reason is that people
in general have not been until lately
interested in any babies but their own.</p>

<p>The difference between ancient and
modern times is remarkable in nothing
more than in the treatment of babies.
Human life, merely as such, was considered
less sacred then than now, and the average
view of the baby was simply utilitarian. Was
the baby, male or female, a healthy baby?
Was it likely to become a sturdy citizen or a
stout soldier, or to be the capable mother of
strong children? Then let the baby live.
Babies that did not satisfy these conditions
were disposed of much as we dispose of
superfluous puppies or kittens. And not
even now, moreover, is baby life considered
throughout all the world as something in
itself delightful and valuable. Savage
people and tribes are not such sinners in
this regard as half-civilised nations like
those of India and China.</p>

<p>"What is the use of rearing daughters?"
asked an intelligent Chinaman not long
ago of an inquiring Englishman. "When
young they are only an expense, and when
grown they marry and go away. Whereas
a son&mdash;&mdash;."</p>

<p>What a world of difference there is
between that sentiment and this of "A
Cradle Song," a recent poem by the young
poet W. B. Yeats, where the mother
addresses her baby thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>
"I kiss you and kiss you, my arms round my own;<br />
Ah! how I shall miss you, my dear, when you're grown!"<br />
</p>

<p>To us, in these later times, and with all
the sentiments of Christian civilisation
fostered in us, it is almost incomprehensible
that any grown human beings could have
the heart to extinguish the first struggling
life of babies; most of all does it seem incomprehensible
that the mother, whose
nature is wont to well up and flow out at
the first helpless cry of her infant, and the
father, whose instinct is to hover over and
protect and "fend for" both mother and
child in their weakness, could ever surrender,
or with their own hands destroy,
the creature whom they have brought into
the world. But, strong as are the natural
instincts, stronger still in many is religious
fanaticism, stronger is a national or tribal
tradition. And when we consider that it
has taken ages of Christian culture and
feeling to bring us to our present height of
imaginative sympathy with all forms of life,
till now we are agreed that no more beautiful,
sacred, or divine sight is to be seen
under the sun than that of a mother with
a child in her arms, then we can understand
that, while it is an outrage, a sin, and
a crime to destroy a child among the
taught of Christendom, it is but a hideous
barbarism among the uninstructed of
heathendom.</p>

<p>Turning to consider particularly the
treatment of babies in various lands, by
various peoples and tongues, we are compelled
to note that even where infanticide
or "exposure" is not practised, a similar
result is worked out through the hardships&mdash;sometimes
unconscious, sometimes designed&mdash;of
infant life. The conditions of
existence among many savage tribes are so
severe that only the "fittest," the sturdiest,
and wiriest constitutions can survive. There
is, for instance, a very fine and intelligent
tribe of blacks in the neighbourhood of the
Cameroons, named the Duallas, which
imposes from the first a very violent test
upon the constitutions of their offspring.
Like the ancient Germans, the Duallas take
a child when only four or five days old and
plunge it in the river. This is repeated
every day till the child is strong and hardy
enough to bathe itself, or till it has succumbed
beneath the treatment. Other less
intelligent and more savage tribes of Africans
train their children to endure torture from
a very early age. Even the average nursing
of the negro mother is enough to try the
toughness of the child's constitution. When
the child is being fed he is set astride his
mother's hip; and he must hold on how
he can and get what nutriment he can,
while his mother moves about her ordinary
duties. When he is not thus attached to
his mother he lies on a little bed of dried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
grass on the
ground, in all the
simplicity in
which Nature brought him into the world,
and crams himself with earth or whatever
he can lay his little black hands on.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/scan349-1.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Red indian
"papooses"</span>:</p></div>
</div>

<p>Akin to the negro's treatment of children&mdash;though
considerably in advance as regards
tenderness and picturesqueness&mdash;is that of
the Red Indians of North America. The
father and mother combine to make a very
curious and ornamental close cradle or bed
for the "papoose." In shape it is not unlike
the long oval shield of the Zulu. The
father cuts it out of wood or stout bark with
his tomahawk and scalping-knife, and covers
it with deer or buffalo skin, or, if he has not
these, with matting or the softest bark of
trees, leaving the upper side loose and
open. The mother then adorns and embroiders
it with beads and grasses, and lines
and pads it with the softest grass or moss
or rags she can find. The "papoose" is
lightly strapped in with soft thongs fastened
to the board and passing under his arms,
and then the covering is laced over him as
one laces up a shoe, and nothing but the
face of the "papoose" is left exposed.
Thus done up, baby can be hung (with a
thong attached to his cradle) on the branch
of a tree, or from the pole of the wigwam,
or set in a corner out of the way. It may
seem to us that the close confinement and
the upright position of these nests cannot
be very comfortable, but it is said that after
tumbling about a while on the grass or
among the dogs of the wigwam the Indian
baby frequently cries to go back to his
solitary nest. In this wise, too, is he
carried, slung over his mother's back, when
the tribe is on the march. The oval thing
we have described is the prevalent pattern
of cradle among American Indians, though
in the extreme north or in the extreme
south modifications of the style obtain. The
Flat-head mother, for instance, makes her
papoose into a round bundle, with folds
of bark and thongs of deer-skin, and carries
it in a wooden receptacle something like a
canoe, slung on her back, with a little
pent-house or shade projecting over the
baby's face.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/scan349-2.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">A Flat-head
Mother.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>It is worth noting that this complete
swaddling of infants is almost universal
among both barbarous and civilised peoples
who dwell in sub-tropical or temperate
climates. It is done not so much (or not
only) to keep the child warm, but to prevent
it from scratching itself, from moving about
and hurting itself, and from bruising itself
or breaking its tender bones if it should
chance to fall. A baby, however, that is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
done up tight and flat as a Red-skin baby is,
must be almost as safe on a top-shelf as on
the ground. The close swaddling and
padding of baby is found, the more we consider
it, to be the fashion among both
civilised and barbarous kindreds, and
peoples, and tongues, where women are very
hard-worked. It is easy to understand how
that must be. When the mother digs and
plants the soil, and grinds the corn, draws
the water and cooks the food for her husband
and children&mdash;as does the savage
woman of every clime&mdash;when she spins and
brews, and makes and mends, and cooks and
cleans, as does the house-wife
of almost every degree
in almost every
country of Europe; when
the mother has thus her
hands full of toil or occupation
from morning till
night, and when the expense
or the convenience
of a nurse is not available,
what can she do,
what must she do, with
baby, but contrive some
means of keeping him
from troubling her and
at the same time from
damaging himself?
Therefore the American
Indian papoose is
bound and laced in
the thing we have
seen; therefore the
Amazon Indian
child is slung in a
close net-like hammock
from tree to
tree; therefore the
New Guinea child
hangs like a bunch
of onions in a bag-net
either from a
jutting bamboo of his father's hut or on his
mother's back by a strap passed across the
forehead; and therefore the European baby
of several countries is wrapped and padded
in the ways we are about to describe.</p>

<p>Of all house-wives
in Europe, probably
the German is the
hardest worked, and
of all European
mothers the German
practises most completely
the art of
swathing and padding
her baby, and
of putting it on the shelf. The German
baby is swaddled in a long,
narrow pillow, which is made to meet
completely round him, being tucked
up over his feet and turned under his solemn
chin. Three bands of gay blue ribbons are
then passed round the whole bundle and
tied in large, florid bows about where his
chest, his waist, and his ankles may be
supposed to be. In this guise he can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>
deposited as an ornament either on the
sumptuous best bed, or on the kitchen
dresser, or on the drawing-room table.
How fond the Germans are of this presentment
of baby may be guessed from the
fact that it figures largely in their
picture-books, among their dolls,
and even in the bakers' shops
at Easter-time, made of dough
and covered with sugar to be
devoured by greedy live
babies.</p>

<p>The German mother
has the completest
confidence in the
safety of her baby
when swaddled
thus. But the
confidence is
sometimes betrayed
by the
wrappage, as witnesseth
the following
story. A party of
peasants set out for the
christening of a new
baby, the baby being
swaddled and wrapped in
the usual manner. The
way was long to the church,
and the weather was cold;
indeed, snow lay on the
ground. The anxiety of the
christening over, the whole
party&mdash;parents, sponsors, and
friends&mdash;adjourned to the village
inn to warm and cheer
themselves with <i>schnaps</i>, or
what the Londoner terms "a
drop of something short." They then
set off on their return home lightly and
gaily, and their hearts being merry
within them they essayed a snatch or
two of song and a step or two of dance.
Home at length was reached, and the
interesting christened bundle was laid
on the table. The whole party&mdash;parents,
sponsors, and friends&mdash;stared agape and in
silence; there was the pillow, the ribbons,
and the bows all complete, but where was
the baby? Someone ventured to raise the
bundle; it was quite limp and empty!
Baby was gone! Back the whole party
hurried on its lonely track, and baby was
found asleep in the snow, about midway
between the church and the village. He
was a sturdy child, and the story runs that
he escaped with a violent sneeze or two,
which, it is said, the anxious parents strove
to allay by popping
him into the oven.
There can be no doubt
that the German child
that could survive
the pillow, and the
snow, and the oven,
must have been sturdy
indeed.</p>

<p>Like the German
mother in her treatment
of infants is the
Austrian&mdash;the real
Austrian, that is, who
is of Teutonic origin;
for the Austro-Hungarian
monarchy includes
so many nationalities, so many
kindreds and peoples and tongues, that it
would need a whole article to write of them
all. And like also, with a curious difference,
is the Swedish and Norwegian mother.
The Swedish child, or <i>barn</i>&mdash;(compare the
Yorkshire <i>barn</i>, and the Scottish <i>bairn</i>)&mdash;is
swaddled in more complex fashion than
the German. It is wound about with six-inch-wide
bandages, sometimes with the
arms free and sometimes not, sometimes the
legs included in the whole bundle, but
usually swathed separately. The bandages
are traditionally supposed to make the
limbs and figure grow straight. The
bandaged <i>barn</i> is then wrapped in a pillow
and tied about with ribbons and bows like
the German child, except that frequently
his arms are free and his legs are shortly
and stoutly suggested by the tucking in of
the pillow. After that he may be fastened
flatwise to another pillow, and slung perpendicularly
from a supple pole stuck in the
wall, so that he looks like a very queer fish
indeed, fit to be shown outside the shop of
an angling-tackle maker. Like the German,
the Swedish child always wears a cap, which is
borderless and of special fineness for its first
Sunday, when it is christened. Then, also,
it wears beads upon its neck, and gorgeous
garments with gay bows of ribbon, all which
are provided by the godmother. In the
remoter parts of both Sweden and Norway
it is still the custom every Sunday to carry
these swaddled infants to church, which is
probably a long way off. They are not
taken <i>into</i> church, however, but buried for
warmth in the snow, in which a small hole
is left for them to breathe through.</p>

<p>In less primitive parts of Sweden and
Norway, however, and among the better-off,
the pillow-bundle often gives place to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
a wooden cradle, shaped
like a trough or a French
<i>baquet</i>, which is usually
suspended by a spiral
spring from the roof.
The elastic motion can
scarcely be of the most
delightful kind to baby
we should think, for there is
nothing to prevent the cradle from
spinning or twisting round at its
will, and so producing dizziness.
In Russia, too, a similar cradle is
used&mdash;contrived, however, more
rudely as to both structure and
motion. It is an oblong box
or wicker basket, with a cord
from each of its four corners
converging to the hook
or the rafter from which
it is hung, and with a
looped cord underneath,
in which the
mother puts her foot
to swing her baby. In
winter&mdash;which in
Russia is long and
severe&mdash;the cradles or,
sometimes, the hammocks
in which the
youngest children sleep
are slung round the
great stove upon which
the parents and other
adult members of the
family pass the night,
wrapped in their sheep-skins.</p>

</div>

<p>France is the only other country in which
the pillow is a necessary complement of the
baby. But the attachment of the two is
nowadays characteristically French. It is
a compromise between the old and the new,
between tradition and fashion, and consequently
it is not universal. The French
baby (especially on gala days) is laid upon
the pillow, and his fine frocks and gay
ribbons, instead of enveloping his tender
body, are spread upon him as he lies, so
that he is no more than a kind of <i>bas-relief</i>.
In France, however, it must be noted there
came earlier than elsewhere in Europe&mdash;(one
of the results of the Revolution)&mdash;the
revolt against mere tradition and usage in
the treatment of babies. Among well-to-do
and aristocratic French folk, in particular,
a change in that regard has long been in
progress. The French child used to have
always its pillow or cradle; now it begins
to lie upon a fresh, wholesome
bed, neither of wool
nor of feathers, but of hair or
straw, or among country or
sea-faring folk of sweet dried
fern or bracken or pungent-smelling
sea-weed; and Government
bureaux circulate among the
peasants such directions as these:&mdash;"Lay
the infant to sleep on its
right side; avoid putting it to
sleep in the lap before putting it
in bed." The French baby used
to wear a multiplicity
of caps&mdash;a small close
cap of fine linen, over
which was a second of
light flannel, and over
that a third of some
light and ornamental
stuff; now the caps are
being discarded, and
baby goes openly and
baldly bareheaded.
There is, however, one
infantile institution to
which well-to-do
French folk cling obstinately,
and that is
the foster-mother or
wet-nurse. The institution
had its origin
ages ago, and was popular
with other than
fine ladies who feared
to spoil their shape
with nursing. It was
under the early Bourbon kings that the
practice first became established of sending
infants into the country, to some
well-known dependant of the house, to
be nursed and fed and brought up.
That is why one reads so much in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>
French literature of foster-brothers and
foster-sisters, who were the peasant children
brought up in the same lap, and at the same
breast as the young lords and ladies. The
wet-nurse who lived in the family was&mdash;and
is still&mdash;commonly a Burgundian, an
ample, handsome, and good-natured type
of woman, something like our own woman
of Devonshire. The fine Burgundian nurse
is still a feature of Parisian life, with her
black eyes, her rich colour, and her opulent
form, her red cloak, her full-bordered cap,
and her long, floating ribbons. It is evident
that this large and productive type is very
old, for there is a curious statute in ancient
French law, called the "<i>droit de douze
enfants</i>:" it obtained only in Burgundy,
and it enacted that all parents of a dozen
children should be exempt from the payment
of any taxes whatever.</p>

</div>

<p>Before we finally turn, whither we have
all this while been tending, to the completest
and wholesomest treatment of babies,
let us note one or two remarkable curiosities
in that way. There is, first of all, the
well-worn, and now almost out-worn, tradition
that Chinese female babies have their
feet tortured by tight bandaging to make
and keep them small. That practice, let us
say at once, was never prevalent, except in
very high society&mdash;like really tight-lacing in
England&mdash;and even there it is now gradually
becoming obsolete. But, among the sweltering
millions of China there is a practice
which seems to have a curious result. The
mother carries her infant in a kind of bag
or pannier on her back, and not&mdash;as in
other countries where the dorsal carriage is
affected&mdash;with the face turned outwards,
but&mdash;as, probably, we ought to expect in
China, where everything seems to go and
come by the rule of contraries&mdash;with the
face turned inwards. The result of that is
that the baby's nose is of necessity pressed
against its mother's back, whence, no doubt,
say the learned in these matters, has been
evolved, in the course of ages, the peculiarly
flattened or blunted nose, characteristic
of the Chinaman. Furthermore,
Chinese girls, even when allowed to live,
are little thought of. In the family generally
they bear no names: they are known
as Number One or Number Two, like convicts,
and they are no more reckoned members
of the family than the cat or the dog.
So when a Chinaman is asked what family
he has, he counts only his boys. And a boy
is treated with great honour and ceremony
by the women. When he is four months
old, he is set for the first time in a chair,
and his mother's mother sends or brings
him many presents, notably among which
is sugar-candy. The candy is emblematic
of the sweet things of life, and it is stuck
to the chair to signify the hope that he may
never lack such things. His first birthday
is the second great day of rejoicing. He is
then set upon a table in front of many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>
things, such as ink, books, tools, &amp;c., and
whichever he first lays his hand on decides
his future occupation.</p>

<p>It is an odd thing that by no people on
earth are children&mdash;both girls and boys&mdash;treated
with more affection and indulgence
than by the island neighbours of the
Chinese&mdash;the Japanese, namely; and no
children have a greater abundance of toys
and amusements. It must, however,
be said that the fondness and patience
of Japanese parents are reciprocated
by the love and obedience of their
children. Both father and mother are
equally devoted to their offspring.
The mother commonly carries her
baby slung in front of her, and when
she is tired the father
cheerfully accepts the
burden; but fathers and
mothers, and elder sisters
and brothers may often
be seen in the gay, sunny
streets of Tokio or Yokohama
giving pick-a-backs
to delighted, crowing
babies. The Japanese
baby, moreover, is not
only indulged, he is also
treated with the greatest
care and intelligence. He
is judiciously fed; he is
regularly bathed either at
home or in the public
bath-houses; and his skin
is stimulated and his
health hardened by his
being frequently plunged in a cold stream,
or even in the snow. A Japanese baby would
appear to us a very droll creature. If you
would know how he looks you have only
to examine a well-made Japanese doll. He
has his head shaved, with the exception of
four tufts of hair&mdash;one in front, one behind,
and one over either ear. He wears bright
and gaudy clothes (or did wear; for children,
like their parents, sad to say, are gradually
being arrayed in European fashion), and his
loose jacket has very long and very wide
sleeves. Very poor children go barefoot;
others wear stockings and clogs, the stockings
having a separate pocket for the big
toe.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/scan354.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Some Japanese
Children</span>:</p></div>
</div>

<p>To find other children as well, wisely,
and wholesomely treated as children are in
Japan, we must come to an English home,
with a look in by the way at an American
home, where, it is said by many, the child
is made somewhat too much of, and therefore
spoiled. But it must be sorrowfully
admitted that it is only the child of well-to-do
or cultured parents in Great Britain that
is as well and wisely cared for, and that is
as happy as the child of Japan: there is no
doubt that the average of childish comfort
and happiness is very much greater in
Japan than in England. Yet a well-ordered
English home is baby's paradise. There he
is not swathed in bandages and rolled in a
pillow and crowned with
a nightcap; he is kept
always clean and sweet,
he is lightly but sufficiently
clothed, and he is allowed
to kick, and crow, and grow strong as much
as ever he likes. He is no longer put to bed
in a deep wooden cradle set on wooden
rockers, but in a light and airy bassinette,
which either is stationary or swings lightly
upon hooks. That question of stationary
or moving bassinette has become somewhat
vexed among mothers, many doctors
favouring the opinion that it is neither
necessary nor desirable that infants should
be sent to sleep with rocking or swinging.
The old rocking cradle had a much more
fearsome motion than the swinging bassinette.
Rocked by a careless or energetic
person it would often make the baby ill;
indeed, there used to be a tradition among
humble mothers (a tradition which still
obtains in Scotland) that if the cradle was
rocked when empty the baby would certainly
be ill when next put into it. The rocking
cradle with its great wooden hood has had
its day (and how magnificent the height of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>
its day was may be guessed from the cradle
of James I. that was shown in the Stuart
Exhibition)&mdash;it has had its day, and is now
departing into the limbo of things obsolete
and forgotten, and thither probably in the
course of years the swinging bassinette will
follow it.</p>

<p>We have in this article treated of babies
only when they are inarticulate, when none
but the mother or the constant nurse can
understand them. That is commonly reckoned
by the stranger or the mere male
person the least interesting age of all, but
to the mother&mdash;and, indeed, to all women
and grown girls&mdash;it is the most interesting.
Then the baby's clinging helplessness, its
wide stare of wonder, and its bright, human
smile and crow of response to a kind look
or tone, suffuse the female heart with an
unimaginable delight. What pride is felt
in the health and beauty and weight of the
baby! ("Here's a leg for a babe of a
week!" says the doctor in Tennyson's
"Grandmother.") How his active crawling
is admired!&mdash;and sometimes his singular
taste for buttons, and marbles, and cinders!
With what wonder and gratulation is the
appearance of his first tooth hailed! With
what expressions of joy is attention called
to his first attempts at walking, and how
"dear" he is when he first goes "pattering
over the boards!" But beyond and beneath
all these common phenomena the earliest
infancy has ravishing mysteries which only
the mother can patiently watch, and pore
over, and understand. Every day, every
hour brings to her a new joy, of which she
can speak to no one; for that which no
else one sees&mdash;the waking attention, the
dawning reason&mdash;the mother sees, and
that which no one else hears the mother
hears.</p>

<p>"The Editor of <span class="smcap">The Strand</span> asks
Sir W. Lawson to send him an article with
some such title as 'Thirty Years of Temperance
Advocacy,' or 'On the Stump for
the Pump.'"</p>

<p>
You ask me to write "On the Stump for the Pump,"
Don't you think 'twould be better, "The Pump on the Stump?"
Sure that "pump" should be able a tale to unfold,
For you hint in your letter it's thirty years old!
Just think of one pumping for thirty long years,
And the water scarce yet has got up to their ears.
Yet while water's so hard to the right pitch to rise,
The full tide of beer mounts quite up to our eyes.
There is Goschen, and Randolph, and Booth, and old Smith,
Men of fame and renown, and great vigour and pith,
They come with their brooms, and they come with their mops,
And they labour and sweep, but the tide never stops.
Away in the torrent go virtue and wealth,
Peace, plenty, and happiness, order and health,
And "Bung" with a chuckle cries, "Pump as you may,
But beer and the brewer still carry the day."
Now you kindly have asked me to say what I think
On this troublesome, terrible question of drink.
So the "Pump" will endeavour to pour something out,
A "pump" at the least should be able to "spout!"
Well, well, I must hope that I shall not quite fail,
So the "Pump," as you've asked him, will pour out his tale.

<p>Almost everyone who proposes a toast
at a public dinner commences his speech
by saying that he feels himself to be the
most unfit person who could have been
selected to perform the duty.</p>

<p>In this matter I am neither the most fit,
nor the most unfit person to give such a
narrative as the Editor desires. There are
many advocates of temperance still living
who have addressed far more audiences on
the subject than I have done, and whose
account of their experience would be far
more interesting and instructive than mine
can be.</p>

"I've been about a bit in my time,<br />
And troubles I've seen a few;<br />
But I always found it the best of plans<br />
To paddle my own canoe."<br />
</div></div>

<p>And I have sometimes had to paddle that
canoe through tolerably stormy waters.
For generations a "Temperance lecturer"
has usually been viewed by the "respectable"
classes with a mixture of pity and
contempt. Drink was blended with all our
ideas of real happiness and enjoyment.
Doctors ordered drink as a potent medicine,
and, at the same time, as a valuable article
of daily diet. Clergymen, certainly at
times, mildly hinted that their flocks might
peradventure be more moderate in its consumption,
but rarely indeed condemned
the thing itself.</p>

<p>Elections were won to the inspiriting cry
of the "National Church and the National
Beverage," while all those who had
enriched themselves by the making and
selling of strong drink were held in the
highest esteem and veneration by the rest
of the community.</p>

<p>For anyone to enter on a crusade against
drink was held to be audacious, vulgar, disreputable,
and unconstitutional, and a man
who took such a course was considered to
be, if not a fool, certainly a hypocritical
knave. I have always thought that Dickens'
portrait of "Stiggins, the Temperance
lecturer," did much to maintain this idea.
Any way, it was in full force at the time
when I ventured to launch the above-mentioned
cause.</p>

<p>But I did not start as a Temperance lecturer.
The field was already well occupied.
Father Mathew, Joseph Livesey, Samuel
Bowling, and many other devoted men had
said pretty well all that could be said in
favour of abstinence from intoxicating
liquor, and, where their teaching had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>
followed, had done a
world of good. What
struck me as very hard
was, that these noble
men should expend
time, money, and labour
at their own
charges in promoting
the Temperance reformation
which Richard
Cobden says "lies at
the foundation of every
social and political reform,"
and that all the
time the Government
of the country should
appoint thousands and
thousands of agents to
promote the sale and
consumption of the
very article which
causes all the drunkenness
and misery.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">AT EXETER.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Be it remembered
that the philanthropic Temperance advocates
got no monetary premium on any
success which they might attain among
the people, while the Government agents
who sold the drink were pecuniarily interested
in every glass which they could
get their customers to
consume&mdash;their system
being one of "payment
by results." For anyone
to raise his voice
against this most lucrative
and powerful monopoly
was looked upon
as an audacious impertinence.
Our meetings
were occasionally broken
up by the friends
and supporters of the
liquor power. I remember
a big meeting
at Exeter with the
present Bishop of London
in the chair. A
disorderly force of men
well primed for the
business invaded and
pervaded the hall, yelling,
singing, and jostling
the audience. They
broke up the chairs and used them as
weapons of offence. The Bishop kept
his seat, perfectly calm and collected, but,
as the police declined to interfere for our
protection, the enemy succeeded in their
object and broke up the meeting, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>
breaking the ribs of our unlucky men and
covering the Bishop and Sir G. Trevelyan
and myself with flour, so that we looked as
though we had just returned from the
"Derby."</p>

<p>At Sandwich, also, we once had a great
row. The publicans' friends pretty well
packed the meeting, and with songs, coees,
horns, &amp;c., prevented our speaking. But
we got a speech out of one of the rioters,
and although short, it was
the best speech I had ever
heard in favour of prohibition.</p>

<p>The man was tolerably
drunk, but able to stand.
Close to the platform was
sitting the great brewer
of the place, looking most
demure and respectable,
but who had probably
directly or indirectly organised
the riot. Steadying
himself as well as he
could, the man pointed
with his hand towards the
great brewer, and simply
said, "I want to know
what's to become of this
gentleman?" If anyone
will ponder on this speech
for a moment or two the nature and object
of the licensing system will be clear enough.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/scan358-1.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">"WHAT'S TO BECOME OF THIS GENTLEMAN?"</p></div>
</div>

<p>As a rule, I think it was generally in the
places where the brewers&mdash;our British Ale
Kings&mdash;were exceptionally strong that these
violent scenes occurred. But generally
when there had been a pretty good rowdy
meeting, we used to come again soon after,
when our friends, taught by the experience,
used to take precautions for ensuring "law
and order," so that the rows probably eventually
did us more good than harm.</p>

<p>One thing which struck me much in perambulating
the country was, that wherever
I went the friends who kindly entertained
me were almost always pessimists, who
asserted that the place we were then in
was one of the very worst places for
drunkenness which could possibly
be found.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/scan358-2.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">"A PESSIMIST."</p></div>
</div>

<p>Of course they could
always be the worst, but this
testimony leads one to think that things
must be bad enough all round.</p>

<p>I suppose the Editor, when asking for
reminiscences of "Thirty Years' Temperance
Advocacy" includes advocacy in the House
of Commons. No one would think that it
was personally needed in that assembly,
but only for the check of intemperance
outside.</p>

<p>Yet I once heard a member, who was
known not to be a teetotaler, say that he
could not believe something which the
Government had stated, although he could
swallow a great deal&mdash;a statement which was
received with great acquiescent cheering
from all parts of the House. But my advocacy
in the House was of prohibition of the
liquor traffic, and not of total abstinence. I
proposed that there should be prohibitory
districts wherever the inhabitants clearly
and distinctly expressed a desire for freedom
from liquor shops. This was thought to be
a most shocking proposition. Was it to be
supposed that the magistrates, who were
the licensing authorities, did not know the
requirements of the neighbourhood far
better than the inhabitants of that neighbourhood
knew it themselves! The very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span>
idea was looked upon as a species of
blasphemy.</p>

<p>A Bill must have two names endorsing it
before it can be introduced into the House
of Commons. At that time I hardly knew
where I should get the second name which
was required. I at last got it in this way. Mr.
Bazley (afterwards Sir Thomas Bazley) then
represented Manchester. Some working
men who were either his neighbours or
constituents, and who were very keen about
the Bill, interviewed him and talked over
the Bill. I fancy he made some objection
to it, when the men said, "Mr. Bazley, is
there not a village
which belongs to you,
and where you prohibit
all sale of drink?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mr.
Bazley, "and with the
best effect."</p>

<p>"And will you not
give us the same power
of protecting ourselves
which you enjoy?"</p>

<p>"I will," said Mr.
Bazley, and he put
his name on the back
of my Bill.</p>

<p>But few indeed
would vote for such
a measure in those
days. Lord Randolph
Churchill said that in
that very year, 1890,
two-thirds of the
members of the House
of Commons were terrorised
by the liquor
trade. And many must
have been in that
abject condition in
1865, when the first
Bill was introduced. At all events, whether
through terror of publicans, or contempt for
Temperance advocates, or ignorance of the
enormity of the evil arising from drinking,
the great majority of the House of Commons
were dead against any legislation
tending to cripple the "liquor traffic." We
had all the old arguments trotted out&mdash;"Liberty
of the Subject"&mdash;"Making men
sober by Act of Parliament," and so forth.
I have sometimes wondered why they
thought it absolutely necessary to iterate
and reiterate all this unmeaning jargon.
They had made up their minds that it
would not be safe to vote against the
publicans, and the preliminary talk was
a superfluous expenditure of energy. On
the first division I only got about
forty votes, and that was a larger number
than most persons expected. But I must
not commence a long story of how we
slowly but steadily gained ground in the
House. The history of all reforms is in its
general features pretty much the same.
Someone has roughly summed up the progress
of reforms by saying, First, they are
laughed at; then they are said to be contrary
to Scripture; then it is said that everybody
knew them before. We have long left for
ever the days of divisions of forty, and now
almost everyone admits
that the public
are entitled to <i>some</i>
powers of self-protection
from the liquor
trade. It is still
thought the proper
thing to call everyone
who is in earnest in
trying to get that protection
for the people,
an extreme man; but
everyone knows that
this is only the orthodox
political slang
which must be employed
when argument
is wanting.</p>

<p>Lord Rosebery has
declared that the Temperance
men are the
backbone of the Liberal
Party. The Conservative
Party also
now announce themselves
to be warm
advocates of Temperance.
We cannot say
that they have been
at it for "thirty years," since they only
took, as a party, any overt legislative action
two years ago by their Compensation to
Brewers' Bill, which they again attempted
to pass last year.</p>

<p>Many persons thought that endowing
publichouses would not tend to reduce
drinking, but, be that as it may, it was
pleasant to see the intense zeal with which
the leaders of the Conservative Party devoted
themselves to what they considered
the interests of Temperance. All the other
business of the Session was set aside. The
Government Press urged no surrender.
Diminishing majorities did not damp their
ardour. The forces were summoned to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span>
present at all costs when this Temperance
measure was on hand. One memorable day
many legislators were absolutely compelled
to hurry back from
Ascot to take part in
an early division. Lord
Hartington was among
the number, and it is
said that, being only
just in time, he was
seen to <i>run</i> through the
lobby, a fact unprecedented
in modern political
history.</p>

<p>All this proves that
there never were so
many Temperance advocates
as there are at
this instant. At the
same time, I am inclined
to think that
there has seldom been
more drinking than
there is in the season
of good trade and high
wages. Whether it will
require an additional
thirty years of Temperance
advocacy before
we deal an effectual
blow at what has been
termed the "intoxicating
interests," who can
say? The good sign,
as noted above, is, that
everybody is calling out
that something must
be done. Englishmen
generally say this for
a long time before they
really do anything, but
the recent prolific response
to General Booth's appeal for funds
to rescue the perishing, seems to indicate
that the public are really and keenly touched
by all the misery
around them.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/scan360.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The General says
"Nine-tenths of England's
misery is Drink."
That is just what the
Temperance advocates
have been saying for
nearly twice thirty
years. Their hour of
triumph is growing
appreciably nearer. It
will come so soon as
the good, noble, and
self-denying men who
now deal with the
misery which General
Booth tells us is the
effect of drink, will
strike at the drink
which is the <i>cause</i> of
that misery. When we
have done that, we
may confidently look
forward to an England
which shall be as
different from the
England of to-day, as
light is from darkness.</p>

<p class="a">N the days when Henry the
Fourth of France was King of
Navarre only, and in that little
kingdom of hills and woods
which occupies the south-west
corner of the larger country,
was with difficulty supporting the Huguenot
cause against the French court and the
Catholic League&mdash;in the days when every
isolated castle, from the Garonne to the
Pyrenees, was a bone of contention between
the young king and the crafty queen-mother,
Catherine de Medicis, a conference
between these notable personages took
place in the picturesque town of La R&#233;ole.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/scan361-2.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">"TWO MEN SAT AT PLAY."</p></div>
</div>

<p>La R&#233;ole still rises grey, time-worn, and
half-ruined on a lofty cliff above the broad
green waters of the Garonne, forty odd
miles from Bordeaux. But it is a small
place now. In the days of which we are
speaking, however, it was important,
strongly fortified, and guarded by a castle
which looked down on a thousand red-tiled
roofs, rising in terraces from the river.
As the meeting-place of the two sovereigns
it was for the time as gay as Paris itself,
Catherine having brought with her a bevy
of fair maids of honour, in the effect of
whose charms she perhaps put as much
trust as in her own diplomacy. But the
peaceful appearance of the town was delusive,
for even while every other house in it
rang with music and silvery laughter, each
party was ready to fly to arms without
warning, if it saw that any advantage was
to be gained thereby.</p>

<p>On an evening shortly before
the end of the conference two
men sat at play in a room, the
deep-embrasured window of
which looked down from a considerable
height upon the river.
The hour was late, and the
town silent. Outside, the
moonlight fell bright and pure
on sleeping fields and long, straight lines
of poplars. Within the room a silver
lamp suspended from the ceiling threw
light upon the table, leaving the farther
parts of the room in shadow. The
walls were hung with faded tapestry. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span>
the low bedstead in one corner lay a
handsome cloak, a sword, and one of the
clumsy pistols of the period. Across a
chair lay another cloak and sword, and on
the window seat, beside a pair of saddle-bags,
were strewn half-a-dozen such trifles
as soldiers carried from camp to camp&mdash;a
silver comfit-box, a jewelled dagger, a
mask, and velvet cap.</p>

<p>The faces of the players, as they bent
over the dice, were in shadow. One&mdash;a
slight, dark man of middle height, with a
weak chin, and a mouth as weak, but
shaded by a dark moustache&mdash;seemed, from
the occasional oaths which he let drop, to
be losing heavily. Yet his opponent, a
stouter and darker man, with a sword-cut
across his left temple, and that swaggering
air which has at all times marked the professional
soldier, showed no signs of triumph
or elation. On the contrary, though he
kept silence, or spoke only a formal word or
two, there was a gleam of anxiety and
suppressed excitement in his eyes, and more
than once he looked keenly at his companion,
as if to judge of his feelings or
learn whether the time had come for some
experiment which he meditated. But for
this, an observer looking in through the
window would have taken the two for only
one more instance of the hawk and pigeon.</p>

<p>At last the younger player threw down
the caster, with a groan.</p>

<p>"You have the luck of the evil one," he
said, bitterly. "How much is that?"</p>

<p>"Two thousand crowns," replied the
other without emotion. "You will play no
more?"</p>

<p>"No! I wish to heaven I had never
played at all!" was the answer. As he
spoke the loser rose, and going to the
window stood looking moodily out. For a
few moments the elder man remained
seated, gazing at him furtively, but at length
he too rose, and, stepping softly to his companion,
touched him on the shoulder.
"Your pardon a moment, M. le Vicomte,"
he said. "Am I right in concluding that
the loss of this sum will inconvenience
you?"</p>

<p>"A thousand fiends!" exclaimed the
young Vicomte, turning on him wrathfully.
"Is there any man whom the loss of two
thousand crowns would not inconvenience?
As for me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"For you," continued the other, smoothly
filling up the pause, "shall I be wrong
in saying that it means something like
ruin?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, and if it does?" the young
man retorted, drawing himself up haughtily,
his cheek a shade paler with passion.
"Depend upon it you shall be paid. Do
not be afraid of that!"</p>

<p>"Gently, gently, my friend," the winner
answered, his patience in strong contrast
with the other's violence. "I had no intention
of insulting you, believe me. Those
who play with the Vicomte de Lanthenon
are not wont to doubt his honour. I spoke
only in your own interest. It has occurred
to me, Vicomte, that the matter might be
arranged at less cost to yourself."</p>

<p>"How?" was the curt question.</p>

<p>"May I speak freely?" The Vicomte
shrugged his shoulders, and the other, taking
silence for consent, proceeded: "You, Vicomte,
are governor of Lusigny for the
King of Navarre; I, of Cr&#233;ance, for the
King of France. Our towns lie only three
leagues apart. Could I by any chance, say
on one of these fine nights, become master
of Lusigny, it would be worth more than
two thousand crowns to me. Do you understand?"</p>

<p>"No," the young man answered slowly,
"I do not."</p>

<p>"Think over what I have said, then,"
was the brief answer.</p>

<p>For a full minute there was silence in
the room. The Vicomte gazed out of the
window with knitted brows and compressed
lips, while his companion, sitting down, leant
back in his chair, with an air of affected
carelessness. Outside, the rattle of arms
and hum of voices told that the watch were
passing through the street. The church
bell struck one. Suddenly the Vicomte
burst into a hoarse laugh, and, turning,
snatched up his cloak and sword. "The
trap was very well laid, M. le Capitaine,"
he said almost jovially; "but I am still
sober enough to take care of myself&mdash;and
of Lusigny. I wish you good-night. You
shall have your money, never fear."</p>

<p>"Still, I am afraid it will cost you dearly,"
the Captain answered, as he rose and moved
towards the door to open it for his guest.
His hand was already on the latch when he
paused. "Look here," he said, "what do
you say to this, then? I will stake the
two thousand crowns you have lost to me,
and another thousand besides against your
town. Fool! no one can hear us. If you
win, you go off a free man with my thousand.
If you lose, you put me in possession
one of these fine nights. What do you say
to that? A single throw to decide."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span></p>

<p>The young man's pale face reddened.
He turned, and his eyes sought the table
and the dice irresolutely. The temptation
indeed came at an unfortunate moment,
when the excitement of play had given way
to depression, and he saw nothing before
him outside the
door, on which
his hand was laid,
but the cold
reality of ruin.
The temptation
to return, and by
a single throw
set himself right
with the world
was too much for
him. Slowly he
came back to the
table. "Confound
you!" he
said irritably. "I
think you are the
devil himself,
Captain."</p>

<p>"Don't talk child's talk!" said the other coldly, drawing back as
his victim advanced. "If you do not like the offer you need not take
it."</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/scan363.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">"WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT?"</p></div>
</div>

<p>But the young man's fingers had already closed on the dice. Picking
them up he dropped them once, twice, thrice on the table, his eyes
gleaming with the play-fever. "If I win?" he said doubtfully.</p>

<p>"You carry away a thousand crowns," answered the Captain, quietly.
"If you lose you contrive to leave one of the gates of Lusigny open for
me before next full moon. That is all."</p>

<p>"And what if I lose, and not pay the forfeit?" asked the Vicomte,
laughing weakly.</p>

<p>"I trust to your honour," said the
Captain. And, strange as it may seem, he
knew his man. The young noble of the
day might betray his cause and his trust,
but the debt of honour incurred at play
was binding on him.</p>

<p>"Well," said the Vicomte, "I agree.
Who is to throw first?"</p>

<p>"As you will," replied the Captain,
masking under an appearance of indifference
a real excitement which darkened
his cheek, and caused the pulse in the old
wound on his face to beat furiously.</p>

<p>"Then do you go first," said the Vicomte.</p>

<p>"With your permission," assented the
Captain. And
taking the dice
up in the caster
he shook them
with a practised
hand, and dropped
them on the
board. The throw
was seven.</p>

<p>The Vicomte
took up the caster
and, as he
tossed the dice
into it, glanced
at the window.
The moonlight
shining athwart
it fell in silvery
sheen on a few
feet of the floor.
With the light
something of the
silence and coolness
of the night
entered also, and
appealed to him.
For a few seconds
he hesitated. He
even made as if
he would have
replaced the box
on the table. But
the good instinct
failed. It was too late, and with a
muttered word, which his dry lips refused
to articulate, he threw the dice. Seven!</p>

<p>Neither of the men spoke, but the
Captain rattled the little cubes, and again
flung them on the table, this time with a
slight air of bravado. They rolled one
over the other and lay still. Seven again!</p>

<p>The young Vicomte's brow was damp,
and his face pale and drawn. He forced a
quavering laugh, and with an unsteady
hand took his turn. The dice fell far apart,
and lay where they fell. Six!</p>

<p>The winner nodded gravely. "The luck
is still with me," he said, keeping his eyes
on the table that the light of triumph
which had suddenly leapt into them might
not be seen. "When do you go back to
your command, Vicomte?"</p>

<p>The unhappy man stood like one stunned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>
gazing at the two little cubes which had
cost him so dearly. "The day after to-morrow,"
he muttered hoarsely, striving to
collect himself.</p>

<p>"Then shall we say the following evening?"
asked the Captain.</p>

<p>"Very well."</p>

<p>"We quite understand one another,"
continued the winner, eyeing his man
watchfully, and speaking with more
urgency. "I may depend on you, M. le
Vicomte, I presume?"</p>

<p>"The Lanthenons have never been wanting
to their word," the young nobleman
answered, stung into sudden haughtiness.
"If I live I will put Lusigny into your
hands, M. le Capitaine. Afterwards I will
do my best to recover it&mdash;in another way."</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/scan364.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">"HE WAS ALONE WITH HIS TRIUMPH."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"I shall be entirely at your disposal,"
replied the Captain, bowing lightly. And
in a moment he was alone&mdash;alone with his
triumph, his ambition, his hopes for the
future&mdash;alone with the greatness to which
his capture of Lusigny was to be the first
step, and which he should enjoy not a
whit the less because as yet fortune had
dealt out to him more blows than caresses,
and he was still at forty, after a score of
years of roughest service, the governor of a
paltry country town.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in the darkness of the narrow
streets, the Vicomte was making his way
to his lodgings in a state of despair and
unhappiness most difficult to describe.
Chilled, sobered, and affrighted he looked
back and saw how he had thrown for all
and lost all, how he had saved the dregs of
his fortune at the expense of his loyalty,
how he had seen a way of escape and lost it
for ever! No wonder that as he trudged
alone through the mud and darkness of the
sleeping town his breath came quickly and
his chest heaved, and he looked from side
to side as a hunted animal might, uttering
great sighs. Ah, if he could only have
retraced the last three hours!</p>

<p>Worn out and exhausted, he entered his
lodging, and securing the door behind him
stumbled up the stone stairs and entered
his room. The impulse to confide his misfortunes
to someone was so strong upon
him that he was glad to see a dark form
half sitting, half lying in a chair before the
dying embers of a wood fire. In those days
a man's natural confidant was his valet,
the follower, half-friend, half-servant, who
had been born on his estate, who lay on a
pallet at the foot of his bed, who carried his
<i>billets-doux</i> and held his cloak at the duello,
who rode near his stirrup in fight and nursed
him in illness, who not seldom advised him
in the choice of a wife, and lied in support
of his suit.</p>

<p>The young Vicomte flung his cloak over
a chair. "Get up, you rascal!" he cried,
impatiently. "You pig, you dog!" he
continued, with increasing anger. "Sleeping
there as though your master were not
ruined by that scoundrel of a Breton!
Bah!" he added, gazing bitterly at his
follower, "you are of the <i>canaille</i>, and have
neither honour to lose nor a town to
betray!"</p>

<p>The sleeping man moved in his chair
and half turned. The Vicomte, his patience
exhausted, snatched the bonnet from his
head, and threw it on the ground. "Will
you listen?" he said. "Or go, if you choose
look for another master. I am ruined! Do
you hear? Ruined, Gil! I have lost all&mdash;money,
land, Lusigny itself, at the dice!"</p>

<p>The man, aroused at last, stooped with a
lazy movement, and picking up his hat
dusted it with his hand, and rose with a
yawn to his feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/scan365.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">"SIRE!" HE SAID.</p></div>
</div>

<p>"I am afraid, Vicomte," he said, his tones
quiet as they were, sounding like thunder
in the Vicomte's astonished and bewildered
ears, "I am afraid that if you have lost
Lusigny, you have lost something which
was not yours to lose!"</p>

<p>As he spoke he struck the embers with
his foot, and the fire, blazing up, shone on
his face. The Vicomte saw, with unutterable
confusion and dismay, that the man
before him was not Gil at all, but the last
person in the world to whom he should have
betrayed himself. The astute smiling eyes,
the aquiline nose, the high forehead, and
projecting chin, which the short beard and
moustache scarcely concealed, were only too
well known to him. He stepped back with
a cry of horror. "Sire!" he said, and then
his tongue failed him. He stood silent, pale,
convicted, his chin on his breast. The man
to whom he had confessed his treachery
was the master whom he had
conspired to betray.</p>

<p>"I had suspected something
of this," Henry of
Navarre continued, after a
pause, a tinge of irony in his
tone. "Rosny told me that
that old fox, the Captain of
Cr&#233;ance, was affecting your
company a good deal, M.
le Vicomte, and I find that,
as usual, his suspicions were
well-founded. What with
a gentleman who shall be
nameless, who has bartered
a ford and a castle for the
favour of Mademoiselle de
Luynes, and yourself, I am
blest with some faithful followers!
For shame!" he
continued, seating himself
with dignity, "have you
nothing to say for yourself?"</p>

<p>The young noble stood
with his head bowed, his
face white. This was ruin,
indeed, absolutely irremediable.
"Sire," he said at
last, "your Majesty has a
right to my life, not to my
honour."</p>

<p>"Your honour!" quoth
Henry, biting contempt in
his tone.</p>

<p>The young man started,
and for a second his cheek
flamed under the well-deserved
reproach; but he
recovered himself. "My debt to your
Majesty," he said, "I am willing to pay."</p>

<p>"Since pay you must," Henry muttered
softly.</p>

<p>"But I claim to pay also my debt to the
Captain of Cr&#233;ance."</p>

<p>"Oh," the King answered. "So you
would have me take your worthless life,
and give up Lusigny?"</p>

<p>"I am in your hands, sire."</p>

<p>"Pish, sir!" Henry replied in angry
astonishment. "You talk like a child.
Such an offer, M. de Lanthenon, is folly,
and you know it. Now listen to me. It
was lucky for you that I came in to-night,
intending to question you. Your madness
is known to me only, and I am willing to
overlook it. Do you hear? Cheer up,
therefore, and be a man. You are young;
I forgive you. This shall be between you
and me only," the young prince continued,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span>
his eyes softening as the other's head
drooped, "and you need think no more of
it until the day when I shall say to you,
'Now, M. de Lanthenon, for France and
for Henry, strike!'"</p>

<p>He rose as the last word passed his lips,
and held out his hand. The Vicomte fell
on one knee, and kissed it reverently, then
sprang to his feet again. "Sire," he said,
standing erect, his eyes shining, "you have
punished me heavily, more heavily than
was needful. There is only one way in
which I can
show my gratitude,
and that is
by ridding you
of a servant who
can never again
look your enemies
in the face."</p>

<p>"What new folly is this?" said Henry, sternly. "Do you not
understand that I have forgiven you?"</p>

<p>"Therefore I cannot give up Lusigny, and I must acquit myself of my
debt to the Captain of Cr&#233;ance in the only way which remains," replied
the young man, firmly. "Death is not so hard that I would not meet it
twice over rather than again betray my trust."</p>

<p>"This is midsummer madness!" said the King, hotly.</p>

<p>"Possibly," replied the Vicomte, without emotion; "yet of a kind to
which your Majesty is not altogether a stranger."</p>

<p>The words appealed strongly to that love of the chivalrous which
formed part of the King's nature, and was one cause alike of his
weakness and his strength, which in its more extravagant flights gave
opportunity after opportunity to his enemies, in its nobler and saner
expressions won victories which all his astuteness and diplomacy could
not have compassed. He stood looking with half-hidden admiration at the
man whom two minutes before he had despised.</p>

<p>"I think you are in jest," he said, presently.</p>

<p>"No, sire," the young man answered,
gravely. "In my country they have a
proverb about us. 'The Lanthenons,' say
they, 'have ever been bad players, but good
payers.' I will not be the first to be worse
than my name!"</p>

<p>He spoke with so quiet a determination
that the King was staggered, and for a
minute or two paced the room in silence,
inwardly reviling the generous obstinacy of
his weak-kneed supporter, yet unable to
withhold his admiration from it. At length
he stopped, with a low, abrupt exclamation.</p>

<p>"Wait!" he cried. "I have it! <i>Ventre
Saint Gris</i>, man, I have it!" His eyes
sparkled, and, with a gentle laugh, he hit the
table a sounding blow. "Ha! ha! I have
it!" he repeated, joyously.</p>

<p>The young noble gazed at him in
surprise, half sullen, half incredulous. But
when Henry in low, rapid tones had
expounded his plan, the Vicomte's face
underwent a change. Hope and life sprang<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span>
into it. The blood flew to his cheeks.
His whole aspect softened. In a moment
he was on his knee, mumbling the King's
hand, his eyes full of joy and gratitude.
After that the two talked long, the
murmur of their voices broken more
than once by the ripple of low laughter.
When they at length separated, and Henry,
his face hidden by the folds of his cloak,
had stolen away to his lodgings, where, no
doubt, more than one watcher was awaiting
him with a mind full of anxious fears, the
Vicomte threw open his window and looked
out on the night. The moon had set, but
the stars still shone peacefully in the dark
canopy above. He remembered on a sudden,
his throat choking with silent repressed
emotion, that he was looking towards his
home&mdash;the stiff grey pile among the beech
woods of Navarre which had been in his
family since the days of St. Louis, and
which he had so lightly risked. And he
registered a vow in his heart that of all
Henry's servants he would henceforth be
the most faithful.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Captain of Cr&#233;ance was
enjoying the sweets of coming triumph.
He did not look out into the night, it is
true, but pacing up and down the room he
planned and calculated, considering how he
might make the most of his success. He
was still comparatively young. He had
years of strength before him. He would
rise. He would not easily be satisfied. The
times were troubled, opportunities many,
fools many; bold men with brains and
hands few.</p>

<p>At the same time he knew that he could
be sure of nothing until Lusigny was actually
his, and he spent the next few days in considerable
suspense. But no hitch occurred.
The Vicomte made the necessary communications
to him; and men in
his own pay informed him of dispositions
ordered by the governor of Lusigny which
left him in no doubt that the loser intended
to pay his debt.</p>

<p>It was, therefore, with a heart already
gay with anticipation that the Captain rode
out of Cr&#233;ance two hours before midnight
on an evening eight days later. The night
was dark, but he knew the road well. He
had with him a powerful force, composed
in part of thirty of his own garrison, bold,
hardy fellows, and in part of six score
horsemen, lent him by the governor of
Montauban. As the Vicomte had undertaken
to withdraw, under some pretence
or other, one-half of his command and
to have one of the gates opened by a
trusty hand, the Captain trotted along
in excellent spirits, and stopped to scan
with approval the dark line of his troopers
as they plodded past him, the jingle of
their swords and corselets ringing sweet
music in his ears. He looked for an
easy victory; but it was not any slight
misadventure that would rob him of
his prey. As his company wound on
by the river-side, their accoutrements
reflected in the stream or passed into
the black shadow of the olive grove which
stands a mile to the east of Lusigny, he
felt little doubt of the success of his
enterprise.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/scan367.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">"HIS COMPANY WOUND ON BY THE RIVER-SIDE."</p></div>
</div>

<p>Treachery apart, that is; and of treachery
there was no sign. The troopers had
scarcely halted under the last clump of trees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span>
before a figure detached itself from one of
the largest trunks, and advanced to their
leader's rein. The Captain saw with surprise
that it was the Vicomte himself. For
a second he thought something had gone
wrong, but the young noble's first words
reassured him. "It is all right," M. de
Lanthenon whispered, as the Captain bent
down to him. "I have kept my word, and
I think that there will be no resistance.
The planks for crossing the moat lie opposite
the gate. Knock thrice at the latter, and it
will be opened. There are not fifty armed
men in the place."</p>

<p>"Good!" the Captain answered, in the
same cautious tone. "But you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am believed to be elsewhere, and
must be gone. I have far to ride to-night.
Farewell."</p>

<p>"Till we meet again," the Captain
answered; and with that his ally glided
away and was lost in the darkness. A
cautious word set the troop again in motion,
and a very few minutes saw
them standing on the edge of
the moat, the outline of the
gateway tower looming above
them, a shade darker than the
wrack of clouds which overhead
raced silently across the sky.
A moment of suspense, while
one and another shivered&mdash;for
there is that in a night attack
which touches the nerves of
the stoutest&mdash;and the planks
were found, and as quietly as
possible laid across the moat.
This was so successfully done
that it evoked no challenge,
and the Captain crossing quickly
with some picked men, stood
almost in the twinkling of an
eye under the shadow of the
gateway. Still no sound was
heard save the hurried breathing
of those at his elbow or the
stealthy tread of others crossing.
Cautiously he knocked
three times and waited. The
third rap had scarcely sounded,
however, before the gate rolled
silently open, and he sprang in,
followed by his men.</p>

<p>So far so good. A glance
at the empty street and the
porter's pale face told him at
once that the Vicomte had
kept his word. But he was too
old a soldier to take anything
for granted, and forming up his men
as quickly as they entered, he allowed no
one to advance until all were inside, and
then, his trumpet sounding a wild note of
defiance, his force sprang forward in two
compact bodies, and in a moment the town
awoke to find itself in the hands of the
enemy.</p>

<p>As the Vicomte had promised, there was
no resistance. In the small keep a score of
men did indeed run to arms, but only to
lay them down without striking a blow
when they became aware of the force opposed
to them. Their leader, sullenly
acquiescing, gave up his sword and the keys
of the town to the victorious Captain, who,
as he sat his horse in the middle of the
market-place, giving his orders and sending
off riders with the news, already saw himself
in fancy Governor of a province and Knight
of the Holy Ghost.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/scan368.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">"THEY HAVE GOT CRÉANCE!"</p></div>
</div>

<p>As the red light of the torches fell on
steel caps and polished hauberks, on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">369</a></span>
serried ranks of pikemen, and the circle of
white-faced townsmen, the picturesque old
square looked doubly picturesque. Every
five minutes, with a clatter of iron on the
rough pavement and a shower of sparks, a
horseman sprang away to tell the news at
Montauban or Cahors; and every time that
this occurred, the Captain, astride on his
charger, felt a new sense of power and
triumph.</p>

<p>Suddenly the low murmur of voices was
broken by a new sound, the hurried clang
of hoofs, not departing but arriving. There
was something in the noise which made the
Captain prick his ears, and secured for the
messenger a speedy passage through the
crowd. Even at the last the man did not
spare his horse, but spurring to the Captain's
side, then and then only sprang to the
ground. His face was pale, his eyes were
bloodshot. His right arm was bound up in
blood-stained cloths. With an oath of
amazement, the Captain recognised the
officer whom he had left in charge of
Cr&#233;ance, and thundered out, "What is it?"</p>

<p>"They have got Cr&#233;ance!" the man
gasped, reeling as he spoke. "They have
got Cr&#233;ance!"</p>

<p>"Who?" the Captain shrieked, his face
purple with rage.</p>

<p>"The little man of B&#233;arn! He assaulted
it five hundred strong an hour after you
left, and had the gate down before we could
fire a dozen shots. We did what we could,
but we were but one to seven. I swear,
Captain, we did all we could. Look at
this!"</p>

<p>Almost black in the face, the Captain
swore another frightful oath. It was not
only that he saw governorship and honours
vanish like Will-o'-the-wisps, but that he
saw even more quickly that he had made
himself the laughing-stock of a kingdom!
And he had. To this day, among the
stories which the southern French love to
tell of the prowess and astuteness of the
great Henry, there is none more frequently
told, or more frequently laughed
over, than that of the famous exchange of
Cr&#233;ance for Lusigny.</p>

<p class="a">T the
age of
thirty-seven,
as our
first
portrait shows him,
Earl Granville, who
had succeeded to the
peerage six years
earlier, and who had
already been for
four years Vice-President
of the Board of Trade, had just
obtained a seat in the Cabinet, and succeeded
Lord Palmerston at the Foreign
Office. Since that time Lord Granville
has filled almost every office of importance
in successive Liberal
Governments. He
was moreover, as
everybody knows,
one of Her Majesty's
most confidential
friends and counsellors.
No Royal
ceremony, whether
a marriage, a christening,
or a funeral,
was complete without
his well-known
dignified, yet genial
presence; and he
probably attended
more ceremonies of
this kind, at different Courts of Europe,
than any other person of his time.</p>

gives the above portraits a melancholy

</div>
<p class="a">LTHOUGH our first
portrait shows Sir
John Millais at the
early age of twenty-two,
he was already
an important figure
in the world of Art; for he had
gained his first medal at the Society
of Arts when only nine, and had,
like Mr. Watts, exhibited his first
picture in the Royal Academy at
seventeen. At the age of this portrait
he had founded, with Holman
Hunt and D. G. Rossetti, the famous
Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, of
which the object was to depict
Nature, not as tinged by the imagination,
but as they really saw
it; a movement which was at first
received with the most violent
abuse, but which, greatly owing to
the eloquent support of Mr. Ruskin,
at last made good its way. Two
years later he was elected A.R.A.,
and ten years afterwards, R.A.
At the age depicted in our second
portrait he was known, as he is
still, as a painter without rival in
range, manliness, and vigour, and in bold
and masterly brush-work. In the year
1885 the Queen marked her sense of his
commanding abilities by conferring upon
him the honour of a baronetcy.</p>

<p class="a">IR Richard Webster
at seventeen, the age of our
first portrait, was leaving
the Charterhouse School
for Trinity College, Cambridge,
where he was greatly
distinguished as an athlete, and where he
won the two miles race against Oxford.
Our second portrait shows him at this
period, in his running costume. At thirty-two,
as in our third portrait, he had already
so distinguished himself at the Bar that two
years later he was made a Q.C., at the
earliest age on record. The brilliance of
Sir Richard's subsequent career is well
known. It may interest our readers to be
told that some portraits, at a country house,
of Sir Richard at various stages of his life,
first suggested to the Editor the notion of
this series, which has proved so popular.</p>

</div>
<p class="a">ISS Marion Terry is
a clever member of a clever
family, and her ability developed
itself early. Already
at the age of six (as
in the first portrait above
given) she was appearing in the part of
little <i>Sybil</i> in Tom Taylor's play, "A Wolf
in Sheep's Clothing." This childish effort
was followed up by others more successful
still, and, at the age at which our second
portrait represents her, she had made a
strong impression, as a mature actress, in
the exacting part of <i>Ophelia</i>. Then she
appeared in several of Mr. W. S. Gilbert's
dramas, as <i>Dorothy</i> in "Dan'l Druce," and
as <i>Galatea</i> in "Pygmalion and Galatea."
Since that time Miss Marion Terry has
played many parts, and with the same
unvarying success, in which her natural
capacity is aided by her grace of action
and the striking charm of her appearance.</p>

<p class="a">T nine years old, William
Lewin (for Terriss is only a
stage name, and the popular
actor is in reality the son of
Mr. Herbert Lewin, the
barrister, and a nephew of
George Grote, the celebrated Greek historian)
was at school at Dr. Grix's, Littlehampton.
He afterwards had several years'
experience first as a sheep-farmer in South
America, and then in North America as a
horse-breeder; but at the age of our second
portrait he had returned to England, and
had appeared upon the stage in the part of
<i>Nicholas Nickleby</i> at the Adelphi. From
that time his success was certain, and has
ever since been growing. At thirty, Mr.
Terriss was playing <i>Captain Molyneux</i> in
the "Shaughraun," with Dion Boucicault,
on the first production of that play in England.
Our last portrait shows him as Mr.
Irving's chief supporter, and, now as ever, an
immense favourite with his brother professionals.
Mr. Terriss holds the medal of
the Royal Humane Society for saving life
at sea.</p>

Theatre, obtained an engagement, went on the stage as an Irish boy

a drubbing which left him senseless. After this taste of stage-life
he obtained an engagement as an usher at the North London Collegiate
School, a post which he was holding at the age of our second portrait.
But all this while he was writing poems, sketches, and burlesque
lectures, and finally, in collaboration with Paul Meritt, he wrote his
first play, <i>British Born</i>, which was a grand success. Since then he
has produced innumerable dramas, and, as a master of construction and
as a realistic writer, he has probably no equal at the present day.</p>

</div>
<p class="a">HE object of this New Industry is to open up a new, profitable,
and, I hope, pleasant way out of the present congested state of the
Lady Labour Market. The Ladies' Fruit and Salad Gardens have been
established at Grange Gardens, Sawley, near Derby, to provide pleasant
homes and remunerative employment for gentle-women who have a taste for
gardening work and wish to add to their incomes or to earn a living.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/scan378-2.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">MISS GRACE HARRIMAN.</p></div>
</div>

<p>It seems to have been seven or eight years since the idea first
came to me that ladies with a taste for gardening might possibly earn
a living by it; but so much needed thinking out, and detail after
detail fitting in, that it is only five years since I myself became a
practical gardener.</p>

<p>The more I inquired into the matter the more plainly I saw that
market gardeners, as a rule, made a good thing of it.</p>

<p>After trying two rented gardens that only proved quicksands, as far
as money-spending on them went, the soil being worn out, and the fruit
trees that were in them most uncertain, I determined to take new ground
in hand, <i>i.e.</i>, break up old pasture and plant a garden after my own
idea of obtaining the greatest amount of produce with the least amount
of labour. I advocate planting dwarf hardy fruit-trees in the open;
and for this reason, that during nine months of the year they need no
labour expending on them after they are once well planted and securely
fenced from rabbits, their winter depredators, and with reason we may
look for a good crop of fruit five years out of seven.</p>

<p>My own experimental garden was planted, March, 1889. That year
we had enormous crops of vegetables of splendid flavour, and a very
fair amount of fruit. Last year our crop of fruit, in addition to the
vegetables, was very considerable. Had the produce of this garden been
for sale, it must have realised a very handsome sum.</p>

<p>To my mind it would be unwise for a woman single-handed to expect
to make a sure, comfortable living out of one isolated garden, but by
well-directed cooperation, thereby being able to grow a great variety
of fruits and vegetables and salads to meet the wants of a private
trade, the chance of the possibility of failure is reduced to a
minimum.</p>

<p>It is not desirable for more than six owners of gardens to live in
one house. When fruit, salads, and vegetables are grown by the acre,
and sold by the dozen, the bunch, or the pound, the book-keeping
necessary must be very considerable. These six ladies can well look
after the three-acre garden, or, rather, fruit plantation. Each lady
has her own portion of half an acre solely under her care, and she
keeps a strict account of everything sold off her portion; and, after
all necessary expenses are paid, the profits, are divided exclusively
among the lady cultivators in proportion as each may, by diligence and
constant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">379</a></span> attention, have produced abundant crops or
otherwise.</p>

<p>Our cultivation of flowers is mainly directed to late autumn,
winter, and early spring ones, those for Christmas and Easter
decorations paying as well as any. The ladies gladly undertake table
and other decorations at any time, as we do not entirely confine
ourselves to autumn, winter, and spring flowers.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/scan379-1.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">BEDDING OUT.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Well directed co-operation being so much more powerful than
single-handed efforts, as soon as the sufficient number of ladies
have definitely signified their intention of joining and showed us
they have the necessary &#163;100 capital (for my five years of active
practical gardening work have plainly showed me that a little capital
is absolutely necessary for a woman to start successful market
gardening), a private Limited Liability Company will be formed&mdash;of
course composed entirely of lady gardeners. The first year they must
not expect to make more than covers expenses, including board of each
household. The work is such that any lady is well able to perform; the
produce grown, all kinds of hardy and dessert fruit under glass and
in the open. Especial attention is given to delicate vegetables and
salads, mushrooms, &amp;c., with flowers and poultry as an adjunct.</p>

<p>The market of the produce grown has from the beginning stood out
plainly before me as the vital point of success. Fortunately by
starting in a thickly populated consuming neighbourhood there seems
every probability of the greater portion, if not the whole, of the
produce being taken by people kind enough to open up deposit accounts
with the lady gardeners. After April 1, the gardens may be seen each
Thursday between 2 and 5 o'clock. Those going will kindly write their
names in the visitors' book, and pay one shilling each for being shown
over. This latter is a necessity, as it takes up the valuable time of
the lady gardeners.</p>

<p>The household arrangements are conducted with the greatest
regularity; the details of the <i>menu</i> even may be gathered by those
visiting the place. The hours of meals are as follow:&mdash;</p>

<p>
Breakfast at       8 a.m.<br />
Early dinner       1 p.m.<br />
Afternoon tea      4 p.m.<br />
High tea           7 p.m.<br />
</p>

<p>During the busiest months of the year, April, May, and June, most
of the day will be taken up with one kind or other of light gardening
work. The long holidays must be taken in the winter. Those left at
home can send off with ease the stored crops as ordered, attend to the
plants under glass, and feed the poultry.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/scan379-2.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE VINERY.</p></div>
</div>

<p>I have been repeatedly asked why I have<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_380" id="Page_380">380</a></span> not started the
industry near London. My reasons for not doing so are many:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) Well-situated, good land, near to a station within a few miles
of town, commands far too high a price to be thought of.</p>

<p>(2) The London market all the year round is far from being the best
obtainable. Some instances have come under my notice where Middlesex
growers have sent their garden produce to one or other of the great
Midland markets, the far higher price obtainable more than out-weighing
the greater amount of freight.</p>

<p>(3) It seemed wiser to start the Industry in a neighbourhood where
the promoter was well known, and had many friends and acquaintances.
It is also within easy distance of one or more of the late summer
and autumn crowded health resorts. The late summer and autumn being
the season when the bulk of all perishable fruits ripen, a moment's
reflection will point out to all that these health resorts are, as a
rule, whether by the seaside or inland, usually in a non-fruit-growing
district. But it would not answer to rely on these places entirely,
because for some months of the year they are practically empty.</p>

<p>(4) No sane people would plant fruit trees on other land than their
own without the protection of a long lease, the very shortest being
thirty years.</p>

<p>I am continually receiving offers of land from all parts of the
country, but I wish it distinctly understood that we entertain the idea
of none unless owned by those of sufficient influence and enterprise to
secure a ready market for the produce grown by the lady gardeners.</p>

</div>

<p>I gather from my correspondents that some do not even grasp the
fundamental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">381</a></span> fact that their &#163;100 is required solely to provide
their own share of garden and house; the smallest, and at the same
time the largest, number to be advantageously placed during the summer
is thirty-six, as many expenses necessary to a fewer number could
well be common to all. More than that number I can also easily and
advantageously place. I have had some hundreds of applications, but I
prefer none to decide until they see the exact model of the Industry,
in full working order now.</p>

<p class="a">Y original name was John Fowler. I am known to the world by one
much more high sounding. This is the first time since I came to man's
estate that I have written the name of my boyhood, and I have never
spoken it. The one I have gone by most of my life is hardly more
removed in splendour from plain John Fowler than the life of variety
and rich experiences I now enjoy compared with the experience of my
early years. I follow one of the fine arts as a profession, and in the
impetuous days of my youth I adopted a <i>nom de guerre</i> of fine sound
and picturesque associations.</p>

<p>I have refused all requests that I would furnish an account of my
youth. I would not speak of it now if I did not feel absolutely certain
that the man well known in certain art circles in London can never be
identified through the autobiographical sketch with John Fowler, the
miller's youngest son.</p>

<p>Private reasons, of no interest to the public, prevent me localising
my early home. I am neither a criminal nor a hero, that people should
be interested in my private life, and my only romantic experience will
be found in this narrative. Telling my story over here will beguile
my heart of a troublesome unrest which came to be positive pain,
pain springing from a flood of memories, when a few moments ago a
piano-organ at the next house played the waltz in "Faust."</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE MILL AT BRACKEN GLEN.</p></div>
</div>

<p>I was born in the dwelling-house attached to a water-mill in
a secluded glen far away in the north of England. My family held
religious views shared by no sect I ever heard of, and lived lives of
extraordinary austerity. No mirror, no musical instruments, no volumes
of poetry, no novels, no games of any kind were permitted in our house.
The furniture was the most simple, consistent with maintaining bodily
efficiency for the performance of the day's work without hindrance
or loss of time; our carpets were of the dullest colour, and were
considered merely as a means of keeping out the cold and economising
fuel. We had curtains on the windows, but they were only to exclude or
divert the draughts. Our clothes were ample and warm, but they were of
the hues of the earth in winter. We spoke few words and in low tones.
We ate and drank in silence. We had no place of worship. The whole
Sunday was spent in solemn walks and reading the Scriptures and a few
pious books. We regarded Quakers as lax Christians.</p>

<p>The household consisted of my father, his wife and children, and
my father's brother, his wife and children. We were so large a family
that all the mill work was done without the aid of strangers, and we
all lived under one roof, in the mill house of Bracken Glen. I was the
youngest, the youngest of all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">383</a></span></p>

<p>Before I knew of any world beyond the mill and Bracken Glen, I
thought it was a busy and cheerful place. Now that I come to look back
on it I know it was one of the most desolate and lonely situations in
all England. People talk of the woes of solitude in the forest, in
an unpeopled island, in a crowd. But the most terrible and corroding
solitude of all is that of a small group of human beings, a large
family sunk deep among mountains far out of the reach of ordinary human
intercourse, and living in such strict customs and observances as
obtained at Bracken Glen. Of course we had the business always going
on, and that prevented our people from going mad. But the mill was not
in the main road. You had to turn up into the Glen to reach it, and
no faces ever appeared in the yard but the faces of people coming on
business to the mill.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/scan383.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">"I FELL GRIEVOUSLY ILL."</p></div>
</div>

<p>As I have said, I was the youngest of the whole Fowler family,
brothers and sisters and cousins. The winter that I was twelve years
of age I fell grievously ill, so ill that they thought I should never
recover. Then, for the first time, I saw a doctor. Our people had no
great faith in doctors, and this was the only occasion on which one had
been in Bracken Glen for ten years.</p>

<p>My father and mother were assured that I was certain to die if I
were not instantly sent to a milder climate, say the Isle of Wight or
some genial part of the South Coast. There was a grave demur, a long
debate, and finally I was despatched to the home of a married cousin
whose name I had heard and of whom I knew little except that he was the
son of my father's eldest sister, that he was not a miller, which was a
reproach to him, and that he did not conform to the observances seen at
Bracken Glen, or indeed hold the same form of religious belief.</p>

<p>I was too weak and wretched when I left home to care about anything,
to care whether I was moved or not, whether I was to taste warmer air
or not, whether I lived or not. If they would only let me alone I think
I should have preferred to die.</p>

<p>I was taken from the cold, bleak, northern Glen where, although we
ground corn never any grew, and carried hundreds of miles south; an
interminable journey, it seemed to my young mind and feeble, sensitive
body.</p>

<p>All through that winter I was delicate, and not allowed out of
doors. My cousin's name was Harding. I had never met either him or his
wife before. He was about thirty, and she twenty-five. They were simple
people, with much of the hereditary aversion from frivolity, but they
were not dogmatic or censorious, and they were beyond and above all the
very kindest people I ever met in all my life. They lived a mile out of
the little town of Bickerton, on the high road. They were childless. He
traded in corn in Bickerton. The taste for grain seemed to run in the
blood of our family.</p>

<p>In my old home my education had not been neglected. I could read
and cypher, and I knew the heaviness of all the weights, and the
dryness of all the dry measures. My father had taught me the elements
of Euclid and Algebra, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384"
id="Page_384">384</a></span> remember that the most awful terrors
were in my mind of what these sciences could be in operation if their
mere elements were so forbidding, and cold, and tyrannical. My father
had a theory that any man able to "keep a set of books" could never be
ship-wrecked in life. He had tried to instil a passion for book-keeping
into my mind. So intense was my loathing of that black art that to this
day the mere mention of it rouses me to fury. In fine, I may say that
I had laid the foundation of what was called a commercial education,
and upon this I had raised up my own sole and overwhelming horror of
arithmetical figures, triangles, debtor and creditor, and unknown
quantities.</p>

<p>Sufficient of the old leaven of the Fowlers worked in Harding, not
only to draw him into the grain trade, but to make him still shy of
"sweet sounds that give delight and hurt not." There was no musical
instrument in the house, but books&mdash;</p>

<p>There were hundreds of books!</p>

<p>An inexhaustible mine of books, and such as I had never dreamed of
before! Books that my cousins Nellie and George had had when they were
young. Fairy tales and stories of adventure, novels and poetry!</p>

<p>In the cold grey times of that winter my soul took fire. My spirit
sprang up from long drowsing in the husk of the chrysalis, and put
forth golden and azure and purple wings, and soared into skies of
endless glories beyond the sun. All day long I went enchanted through
enchanted palaces, where moved stately princesses with gold brocaded
robes and haughty eyes, and voices of mystic tones. I led armies
against the Saracen, and spread terrors never dreamed on earth before,
and exercised clemencies that made heaven envious. I headed cavalcades
through winding streets where the air was thick with banners. I bore
the Black Knight backward out of his saddle in the list, and clove
the plumed helmet of the leaguer in the breach. I harangued my troops
on the field of victory, and pardoned my foes in the shrines of their
heathen gods.</p>

<p>But I did not know how the sound of a trumpet stirred, or what
dancing was, or love. I had never heard a musical instrument in my
life or seen a festival, and I was too young for love&mdash;and yet,
perhaps, not all too young for noble love and chivalry, if the princess
or the lady came my way.</p>

<p>With the spring of the next year health began to stir in my veins.
I shook off all the lassitudes and languors of illness, and by April I
felt better than ever in my young life before. With returning health,
the romantic rapture which had come to me out of books grew and
intensified. There was no talk of my going home, or more correctly,
there had been talk of it, and my kind relatives, the Hardings, had
declared that nothing but force should take me from them until I had
been fully fortified by spending a whole summer in the more genial
south.</p>

<p>In our own Glen, all the time I could steal from the detested
weights and measures and triangles, and debit and credit side of the
fabulous transactions of that creature, John Jones, Esq., I spent far
afield among the hills. Here, near Bickerton, this spring I found
all I cared for of Nature in the sky above me, and in the large,
old-fashioned garden; and all I desired of enchantment in the magical
books. I rarely went beyond the garden-gate, and never into the town.
I became a youthful recluse in the boundless realms of fancy. I lorded
it over empires and cities of men. Space, the space of the furthest
wandering star, was not vast enough to accommodate the realms that rose
in mist out of the pages of the poets and romancists.</p>

<p>I was a precocious boy. I knew nothing of boys' games and sports,
and all at once I had come out of the cold, arid life at Bracken Glen
into the rich and varied lights and colours of poetry. The change was
overwhelming and intoxicating. My reading had, in a vague way, been
progressive. I had begun with fairy tales. To these had succeeded
stories of adventure and travel, and to them poetry and plays. Prose
romances and novels came last, for I had fought shy of them at first,
considering that they dealt too much with people and scenes like those
in my own experience of life. When first I broke free among books I
wished to forget the world.</p>

<p>Towards the end of April two things drove me to the novels. The
supply of other books had been exhausted, and I began to yearn after a
glimpse at what possibilities of poetry and wonder still existed in the
world, as the world was going on outside the sphere of my experience.
I wanted to see in books the things now visible to other eyes still on
earth&mdash;things hidden from me by barriers of age and circumstances
I could not understand.</p>

<p>From this desire arose the romance of my life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">385</a></span></p>

<p>One evening George Harding mentioned at tea that Mr. Seymour, a
gentleman who owned an estate in the neighbourhood and had a fine
house, Trafford Manor, a couple of miles further out from Bickerton,
was going to give a ball the end of that month. The Hardings did not
look on balls as exactly wicked, and said nothing for or against the
approaching party. They did not, of course, know the Trafford Manor
folk, who were county people, and quite inaccessible to traders in
Bickerton.</p>

<p>If my cousins had conscientious scruples against going to balls,
and if the social position of the Seymours forbade any chance whatever
of an invitation, the husband and wife were willing to talk of the
approaching festival. They discussed it in no measured terms. They
said it would be the most distinguished and splendid event of the
neighbourhood for the year. They enumerated the distinguished and rich
and powerful people who would attend. They talked of the grounds being
lighted up with lamps, and the house one vast illumination from roof
to cellar. They spoke of the dancing and the bounteous table and the
plenteous wine and the strings of carriages coming up the drive, of the
brilliant costumes, and the jewels and lovely women, of the fountain
spouting on the lawn, and the band&mdash;the band of famous musicians
from London, who, though they came by night to places like Bickerton
in sober black cloth coats and played with fiddles, were yet entitled
to wear in London magnificent red coats all slashed and braided and
piped and gathered with cords and knots of gold; musicians who not only
could play with marvellous skill on stringed, brown wood instruments
while they sat on chairs, but had, in their natural sphere in London,
great brazen and silver instruments to play upon as they rode through
the crowded streets of the marvellous capital on jet black prancing
chargers, whose bridles were of steel shining like silver, and upon
whose forehead blazed burnished, brazen stars.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/scan385.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">"THEY SPOKE OF THE FAMOUS MUSICIANS."</p></div>
</div>

<p>In the novels I had read there had been descriptions of balls. I
had no more thought when reading that it could ever be my luck to see
one than I had considered my chance good of fighting North American
Indians, or cutting out French sloops, or riding from London to York on
Black Bess.</p>

<p>Now, a ball had not only come within my ken, but had been brought
to my very door. What could be easier than for me to slip out of my
room when all the house was asleep, walk to Trafford Manor, enter the
grounds, and behold the miraculous sight through a window or open door,
and, when I had filled my soul with a scene of fairy-land realised,
steal back to my room unnoticed by anyone in the house? The Hardings
were, of course, much older than I. They were man and woman and I only
a boy not yet in his teens, but they had no<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_386" id="Page_386">386</a></span> halo of parental awe,
no parental authority or infallibility.</p>

<p>I had never in all my life heard a musical instrument. At the ball
there would be a band. A band was several musical instruments playing
all together. What could that be like? Would it resemble several people
talking at once? That would be horribly confusing. But it could not be
like several people talking together, for people spoke of a band as a
source of fine pleasure. Would a band of several instruments playing
at one time be like a parti-coloured card spun round? Hardly; for
that only confused the colours, so long as they could be known to be
separate colours, and only made a dull stain when they mingled in one
tint.</p>

<p>My first care was to keep my intention to myself. My second was to
survey the ground of future enterprise. There was no difficulty about
either of these precautions. I had merely to hold my tongue and to walk
to Trafford Manor along a beautiful, undulating, winding, wooded road
which passed by our modest gate, and before the stately portal of the
great house.</p>

<p>The beauty of Trafford Manor was renowned in all the south, and the
owner was proud of his grounds and opened them to all who chose to see
them.</p>

<p>One morning, to the astonishment of my cousin Nellie, I announced
my intention of going for a long walk. She was delighted, crammed my
pockets full of the best good things in the larder, and declared that
she should resent seeing me before dinner.</p>

<p>That whole day I spent in the Trafford demesne. Surely nowhere was
scene more fitted for a fairy <i>fête</i>. It was mid April, and clear
and sunny weather. The air was full of fresh spices of the swelling
buds and of the dainty, delicate, flat leaves already unsheathed and
glittering moist and green in the flowing air. It was rapture to live
and breathe, and heaven to know as much and no more of the world
of things than books taught, no more than enough to set the spirit
dreaming. All the senses brought fuel for poetry, if the sacred flame
fluttered inside. As yet the trees were only misty with verdure. The
depths in depth of vestal green in the woods took the eye into such
enchanted bowers of the imagination, it was like praying, to stand and
listen to the soft, ample murmurs of the multitudinous leaves as the
broad air came by them out of the opening south.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/scan386.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">"CRAMMED MY POCKETS FULL."</p></div>
</div>

<p>In that far off Bracken Glen I often knew promptings towards the
spirit of the heather and the glen and the skies. But then I felt
Nature spoke a language I did not understand, which no one about me
seemed to hear. In the midst of my most ecstatic trances I recalled
myself by conceiving what a poor opinion John Jones, Esquire, of the
soddened book-keeping, would hold of me if he knew that I was wasting
time in hearkening to fancy instead of those pipes of wine which never
knew rest in the day-book, journal, or ledger, or trying to remember
thirteen times, or endeavouring at all events to trisect the angle at
which the brown ground of the bluff bit through the verdure of the
hill to the gash where the stream gushed forth through ragged rocks
on its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">387</a></span> way to the pond above our overshot wheel.</p>

<p>But now I had met, in the modest library of the Hardings, men who
would gag John Jones, Esquire, if he opened his mouth to speak in those
sylvan dales of Trafford, men who would condescend to have no dealings
whatever with pipes of wine, except to drink in them the ladies of
their love, and who would not allow a triangle into their presence,
except for the purpose of tricing up John Jones, Esquire, to it, and
giving him five dozen with the cat!</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/scan387.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">"SLIPPED DOWNSTAIRS."</p></div>
</div>

<p>The Hardings usually retired early, and
in the first days of my visit, when I felt the
first flush of freedom from the stricter rules
of my own home, when I stirred under the
inspiriting touch of the outer world, faint
though it might be, through the intercourse
of George Harding with it, I felt grieved
that they would not sit later of nights and
let me listen in awakening silence to their
news of the great world beyond.</p>

<p>On the night of the ball I thought they
would never rise to go. It would not do
for me to betray the least anxiety. Other
nights I had never shown any desire to go
to bed. It would not do to challenge
attention or excite suspicion by exhibiting
any hurry this night. It was hard to sit
and hear of all the preparations for the
great ball, and feel that my cousins were
standing between me and a sight of the
glories about which they could only
speculate.</p>

<p>I had heard that people would not begin
to arrive at Trafford Manor until late, but
I was consumed with impatience to be off.
At last the blessed moment of release came.
My cousins went to bed, and I found myself
alone in my room at the back of the house.</p>

<p>No great strategy or caution was necessary
to escape. I waited half an hour, then
slipped downstairs, carrying my boots in
my hand, and stole out by the back door.</p>

<p>When I found myself in the garden I
had almost to grope my way, the night was
so dark. I could not see the clouds over-head,
but they must have been thick, for
not a star shone in all heaven, and they
must have been low, for the air was unusually
warm considering the season. I
sat down on a garden chair and put on my
boots. Then rising, I drew a full breath,
made quietly for the road, and, turning my
back upon the town, set off at a good pace
towards Trafford Manor.</p>

<p>I don't know what o'clock it was, but the
low mutter of vehicles was behind me and
before me in the darkness, and every now
and then the lights of a carriage flashed
into view in the rear, and the carriage
dashed past, carrying before it into the
blackness a shield of light raised up by its
lamps.</p>

<p>Here was lonely I at last, the hero of a
romance! Surely it was a romance to steal
away in the dead of night and set out alone
in search of adventure. For although I
had but one intention clearly defined at
starting, that of getting sight of the ball,
now that I found myself on the way was I
not fairly circumstanced to encounter adventures?
Might not the horses under
one of the carriages break away from control,
placing in peril the precious and lovely inmates,
until I dashed forward and rescued
them, winning guerdon of lovely looks and
loud-sounding fame? Might not thieves
and highwaymen lurk in the impenetrable
boscage, and, breaking forth, threaten
the ladies with death, until I, bursting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">388</a></span>
among the throng, scattered the marauders
and entered the Manor in triumph with my
peerless charge? A great general driving
by might fall into some terrible danger from
onslaught of enemies, or the breaking of a
wheel, and I might chance upon his deliverance,
and he, in gratitude, might make
a general of me, and send me against the
Indians or the Kaffirs. Or a high admiral,
being unused to the land, might be met by
me wandering about on foot and alone&mdash;lost,
not knowing where to turn for food or
shelter, and I might guide him to both, and
he might order that henceforth I was to be
Captain of the saucy <i>Arethusa</i>.</p>

<p>Any one of these adventures was likely
to befall one in my position and circumstances,
and it would be only prudent to
keep oneself in a fit state of mind to deal
with all of them. The fit state of mind
was the enthusiastic and heroic; and in a
very enthusiastic and heroic disposition I
trod the road, and arrived at the lodge of
Trafford Manor demesne.</p>

<p>Here no difficulty presented itself, for
both the great iron portal and the two side
gates stood wide, inviting all men to enter.</p>

<p>I had not in my old home at Bracken
Glen been used to bars and bolts, and I had
no awe of social superiors, because I had
come in contact with none. But I had
grave timidity towards strangers of any
kind, and, although the rank of the folk at
Trafford Manor had no fears for me, I
stood in awe of people who could command
the wonders of which the Hardings had
spoken. Such people were of rather a
different order of being, like the genii of
Eastern tales, than merely richer and better
born people of the same race as myself.</p>

<p>I walked into the grounds with as much
confidence as I had travelled the high road.</p>

<p>All thoughts of the past and future left
me in presence of the scene on the lawn
before the house. I no longer wanted to
take part in any enterprise of hazardous
adventure. I no longer yearned to distinguish
myself and win plaudits or
enduring fame. I only wanted to be let
alone. I only wanted to be. I only
wanted to wander about this land of
romance, and drink in all the loveliness at
my wide young eyes.</p>

<p>In the centre of the lawn the fountain
threw up a ghostly wavering pillar of water,
soft as smooth, and tinted with light of
various hues. Down the arcades of the
tress swung lines of coloured lamps. Here
and there, round the trunk of oak, or
beech, or lime, clustered a group of blue,
and green, and yellow lamps, like the flame
of giant gems sparkling on the dark,
tasselled, trailing robe of night.</p>

<p>People were walking about, not bidden
guests at the Manor, but those who, like
myself, had come to see the place by night.
I took no notice of anyone. I took no
notice of anything, but the intoxicating
atmosphere of delight through which I
moved. I did not think. I was content
merely to feel the enthralling influence of
the scene. This was my first experience of
poetry realised, of dreams in tangible form,
of visions of the day taking material form
at night.</p>

<p>All at once I came upon a French window
wide open, with, beyond it, a vast
room lit by one huge chandelier. The
floor shone like dark ice shadowed by brown
rocks, and down the dark ice figures of men
and women glided. The necks and
shoulders and arms of the women were
bare, and in their hair flashed incandescent
points of shifting fire. Their robes were
flowing, and of all colours, like the silent
column of smoke rising up in the lawn,
only the colours were richer and more
varied. The long dresses of the women
swept the floor as they moved to and fro,
their white-gloved hands on the arms of
their cavaliers.</p>

<p>I stood spell-bound. My eyes went on
seeing, yet discovering nothing new, as
when one looks at the lonely sea. Mere
seeing was a delight inexpressible, a delight
that held me fast, as though the air around
me was adamant.</p>

<p>In front of me, by the window, stood a
woman whose beauty was so splendid it did
not seem human. It was a perfectly
colourless face, of most exquisite profile,
clear and sweet as a cameo. She did not
strike me as of any age. As she seemed
now she must always have been, for any
change would not leave her perfect, and
it was very plain she was designed for perfection.
There was in her a settled decision
of line that precluded the idea of her ever
being otherwise than as she was now&mdash;beauty
absolute.</p>

<p>Could ever man that lived be worthy to
touch the hand of this ethereal princess
standing tall and dark against the light of
the chandelier in the doorway? Could any
mere man be privileged to do her a service,
to save her from fire or battle or the sea?
To breathe the air she sanctified by her
presence? To live in the garden through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">389</a></span>
which she walked? To merit her smile?
To die for her?</p>

<p>When poets spoke of goddesses they
thought of her.</p>

<p>Then softly, and yet all at once, as my
amazed and incredulous eyes were fixed
upon this miracle, the air was stirred in a
way I had never known it stirred before.
Something subtler than light came through
it and touched me, and stole into my veins,
and made my blood richer and indescribably
precious in my heart. The flames of the
candles swayed in a strange, intelligible, inexplicable
sympathy with this new sense in
me. The essences of all perfumes were
poured in upon my brain and made me
giddy with a rapture I had never dreamed
life could hold. All at once and by no
effort of my own I came into possession of
some property of joy beyond the glory of
light and colour, beyond the reach of perfume.
It came from beyond where this
miracle of womanhood against the light
stood. It beat by her like wind, and yet it
stirred not one petal of the flowers in her
hair. But the influence of it possessed her
face, and she who had been Grecian goddess
became an enraptured spirit. What
could it be? Had the gate of Paradise
opened, and was some large and subtle and
fine rapture flowing towards me and around
me, and possessing me with rhythmical joy?</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">"THE POOR BOY HAS FAINTED."</p></div>
</div>

<p>What could this new thing, this mysterious
agony of delight be?</p>

<p>Then, like a flash, I knew.</p>

<p>It was the band!</p>

<p>It was the band, and I was hearing music
for the first time in my life!</p>

<p>After that with me all grew dark and
blank.</p>

<p>I had fainted.</p>

<p>I was found lying
on the grass, and
when I came to myself
that being whom
I took for more than
mortal was kneeling
beside me and
bending over me,
chafing my hands,
and saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Quick! quick!
bring a light and
water! The poor
boy has fainted."
Others were around
me, and some hurried
away.</p>

<p>"Poor boy!"
I thought.
"<i>Poor</i> boy,
whom <i>she</i> has
touched!"</p>

<p>"What
caused it?"
she asked me,
pushing my
hair back from
my forehead.
"What a pretty
boy he is. Do
you know,
dear, what
caused it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," I said, as well as I
could; "I think it must have been the band.
I never heard music before."</p>

<p>"Never heard music before?" she cried
in astonishment, "Are you sure? Where
have you lived that you never heard music
before?"</p>

<p>"In Bracken Glen&mdash;a glen in the north,"
I said. "We have a mill there. Our people
do not have music, and I never heard music
until I heard it now."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">390</a></span></p>

<p>"And you fainted when you heard it
first?" she asked, helping me to rise.</p>

<p>"I can think of nothing else to make me
faint. This is the first time I ever fainted."</p>

<p>"You are better now?"</p>

<p>"I am quite well, thank you. I shall go
away now."</p>

<p>"No, not yet. I am much interested in
you. There must be something uncommon
in the boy who fainted when he heard
music for the first time. It was the waltz
in 'Faust.' My husband will be most interested
in this. He knows a great deal
about music, but I think this will be new
to him."</p>

<p>There may have been something uncommon
in that boy who fainted on hearing
music for the first time. People who know
me by the name I now bear before the public
say I have a faculty of producing melody
that will satisfy. I have said that I follow
one of the fine arts as a profession. I am
a musician&mdash;a composer of music. That
lady who twenty years ago saw me fall to
the ground outside Trafford Manor, and
came to my help, has aided my career in
many ways. She spoke of me to her husband,
who knows more about music than
any other man I am acquainted with. She
encouraged me in my hours of depression,
of despair. She has done more kindnesses
for me than any other woman&mdash;but one. I
am now a successful man. I am proud to
owe all I own of value in the world to her.
The one woman I am more indebted to
than to her, I owe, in a way, to the lady of
the "Faust" waltz also, for her daughter
is my wife. It was while I was a guest at
a ball in Trafford Manor that I told my wife
Gertrude of that memorable night long
ago. It was while she was standing by the
same window where her mother had stood
nineteen years before, and looking as her
mother looked then, that I found courage
to speak. The band played again the
waltz in "Faust." Then I lost control, and
the overwhelming love for the girl at my
side bore me away; and I cried out to her
in my despair, and asked if there was any
hope for me in her heart.</p>

<p>She did not understand me. I had not
made my meaning plain. We went out
upon the lawn, where many years ago I
had watched the fountain mount through
the rainbow-coloured lights. It was not
now early spring, but deep summer. It
was not now with me the admiration of a
child for a statue, but the passion of a man
for a woman. The first strain of melody
had been a revelation to the boy. How
poor and thin it seemed to the revelation
that there was hope for me in the heart of
the girl I loved. Before the band finished
that waltz in "Faust," Gertrude understood
what I had whispered in the doorway.
That waltz in "Faust" had played
in music to my soul, and my darling to my
arms. I never hear it without experiencing
incommunicable emotions. Who
can wonder?</p>

<p class="a">HAKESPEARE'S words to
the effect that the man who
has no music in himself is fit
only for treasons, stratagems,
and spoils, might appropriately
be adapted to flowers.
Certainly the man or woman who finds it
impossible to love the rose and the violet,
the chrysanthemum, and even the simple
little primrose which will be so much
abroad during this month of April,
is lamentably lacking in something.
So much is indisputable of flowers in
general, and of the subject of this paper in
particular. The rose alone excepted, no
plant has inspired the abiding love shown
for the orchid, and, not even excepting the
rose, none has been the object of such
enthusiasm. The study of the orchidaceous
family, as some one has said, is a liberal
education, and it was once declared, with all
the authority of print, that Mr. Joseph
Chamberlain must be possessed of a fine
character because he loves these extraordinary
flowers. If the predilection for orchids
is to be accepted as proof of any such
possession, the English race is in no danger
of deterioration.</p>

<p>Many of our readers will have heard of
the tulip mania which raged so fiercely in
Holland about the middle of the seventeenth
century, when simply fabulous prices were
given for a single bulb. There was little
that was either reasonable or explicable in
the desire to secure the tulip at all costs, but
the popularity of the orchid is easily understood
by anyone who cares to go into the
subject. We venture to believe that by the
time we have said all we have to say&mdash;and
how small a portion that is of what we
could say!&mdash;those who peruse this paper
will find it somewhat difficult to resist
running off to the nearest nurseryman and
asking to be shown over his houses, or to
the nearest bookseller and ordering one of
the numerous popular manuals which will
instruct them how to set about becoming
orchid growers themselves. We have often
heard the uninitiated wonder what there is
to attract in the orchid, more than in any
other beautiful flower. Well, to say nothing
of its exquisite and unique charm as a
mere spectacle, Darwin gave many reasons,
and the Darwinian mind, we believe, has
actually sought to show that the orchid is
the missing link between animal and
vegetable nature. The student will find
lots to support this fascinating theory, and
to induce him to think that if the other
missing link&mdash;that between the man and the
animal&mdash;is discoverable, we shall have completed
the chain of nature starting with
man and ending with the garden cabbage.
But all this is another story, with which it
is not our province now to deal.</p>

<p>Orchids have been really popular about
twenty-five years. They were well known
in the last century, but they were the
possession of the privileged few, and were
regarded as a mere floral curiosity. One
day, however, some sixty years or more
ago, the late Duke of Devonshire chanced
to come across an orchid from Demerara,
which bore an extraordinary resemblance
to a butterfly. His delight was immense,
and he proceeded forthwith to cultivate the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">392</a></span>
plant, of which a variety is shown in our
illustration of the <i>Oncidium Kramerianum</i>.
A little later he purchased a "Moth
Orchid," for which he paid 100 guineas;
and to the interest taken in these floral
mimics by the ancestor of Lord Hartington
are traceable the developments which have
been so remarkable during the last decade
or two.</p>

<p>Almost the first thing that strikes the
spectator at an orchid show for the first
time, after he has recovered from a sort of
shock at the overwhelming beauty of the
display&mdash;a display out-rivalling the rainbow
in its variety and blend of colour&mdash;is
the quite ludicrous resemblance of many
of the flowers to animals, birds, and
insects. Bees, spiders, grasshoppers, flies,
lizards, and toads are quite common forms
of orchid mimicry. Our illustration of
<i>Cycnoches Warscewiczii</i> shows a swan,
with a curious-looking tuft upon its
breast. Another species is very like a dove
as it may be seen hovering for an instant
near the branch of a tree before alighting.
One group has a flower in which a resemblance
to the monkey is found; but
the most ludicrous of mimetic vagaries is
surely that of the species known popularly
as the "Man Orchid." "Dressed like an
acrobat in skin tunic of green, it
swings as if gibbeted, in company
with some fifty other little felons."
But the flower is not content to run
animate nature close in outward
appearance; it evinces a disposition
to rival man in the manufacture of
various kinds of appliances. It takes
a hint from the boot-maker, and produces
the "Lady's Slipper"; it provides for the
wants of a young family, and turns out a
"Cradle"; it even resolves itself into a sort
of swimming bath, in which the bee sometimes
finds himself involuntarily immersed,
and from which he escapes by means of a
side-door arrangement. Well might Darwin
say that the
orchid family
seemed to have been
modelled in the wildest
caprice. Proteus himself
was incapable of assuming
so many shapes.</p>

<p>The prevalent notion that
these marvels are only for
the owners of heavily-laden pockets
dies hard. A pious wish that orchids
were less expensive and could be
grown at home is not uncommon.
It will be a revelation to some people
to learn that an orchid which shall be a
source of endless amusement and of considerable
instruction may be had for a few
shillings. Whether, in short, you have a
few odd hundred pounds or merely a few
odd hundred farthings to spare, you may
gratify your love for this particular flower.
You cannot expect to walk into, say, Mr.
Bull's establishment in the King's-road,
Chelsea, some day when you are passing,
and for the price of a couple of dozen cigars
appropriate the beautiful <i>Cœlogyne cristata
alba</i>, some idea of whose virgin purity is
conveyed in our illustration. This plant
originally cost Mr. Bull &#163;200. Great as
this price is, it is barely two-thirds of the
record; &#163;300 has been exceeded for a
single plant. Mr. Bull possesses a variety
of the "Lady's Slipper" for which he paid
that very figure. In 1883 Sir Trevor
Lawrence paid 235 guineas for an orchid,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">393</a></span>
and Baron Schröder paid &#163;165
and &#163;160 respectively for two
plants. Many firms have paid
hundreds of pounds for the
possession of a rare species,
whilst, of course, one may often
hear of a collection being sold
for many thousands. At the
same time, Mr. Bull or Messrs.
Veitch, or any well-known
cultivator will be happy to
place orchids, which a few years ago
were beyond the reach of even a large
proportion of the middle classes, at your
disposal for five or six shillings.</p>

</div>

<p>And be it understood, in buying an
orchid you can never be quite sure that
you have not secured a veritable treasure.
The speculative element enters into orchid-collection
to a degree undreamt of by the
outsider. As the value of the most
valuable just purchased by a duke may
disappear in an hour, so that of the most
common just purchased by yourself may be
augmented a hundred-fold
by an eccentricity.
Take an instance of depreciation
recorded by
Mr. F. W. Burbidge.
A species of "Lady's
Slipper" was imported
and the single plant
fetched &#163;100 easily.
But the home of the
plant was discovered,
and in the course of a
week or two nurserymen
were selling the same
thing for five
shillings. On
the other
hand, Pescatore's
<i>Odontoglot</i>,
we are
told, had
been imported
for years,
and plants
might be
picked up for
a few shillings each, when "quite unexpectedly
a lovely form heavily barred
with purple appeared, and, had it been
sold by auction when first it flowered, it
would have brought from &#163;50 to &#163;100."
Before it bloomed the plant would, in
common with others of the same species,
have been readily disposed of for a trifle.</p>

<p>A friend of Mr. Burbidge's chanced to
buy cheap a number of plants which were
"hanging fire." "They were shrivelled
plants of <i>Odontoglossums</i> in paper bags,
and they took a good deal of skill and
attention to bring them into vigour and
health again. But when they bloomed
some of them turned out very distinct,
and an offer of &#163;500 made for the lot as
they stood, after the first five or six had
bloomed, was not accepted." The most
interesting piece of luck of this sort, however,
which we have come across is related
by Mr. Frederick Boyle. A Mr. Spicer, a
tea planter in Sylhet, knowing his mother
in England was fond of orchids, sent her
some plants. They were an ordinary
"Lady's Slipper" variety. Mrs. Spicer
brought them to flower, and noticed certain
curious characteristics. She consulted an
expert, with the result that he paid her
seventy guineas down and carried off the
plant. "For years," says Mr. Boyle, "this
lovely species was a prize for dukes and
millionaires," and its introduction was due<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">394</a></span>
to a son's desire to gratify his
mother's tastes by sending her a
few everyday
orchids!</p>

<p>The mention of
this discovery
brings us to the
more tragic side
of orchid collecting.
Mr. Sander,
the famous orchid
grower of St. Albans,
despatched
a representative to
try to find the
particular species
which had proved
so profitable to
Mrs. Spicer. After
many fruitless
efforts, "Mr. Forsterman
got on
the track, but in
the very moment of triumph a tiger barred
the way, his coolies bolted, and nothing
would persuade them to go further. Mr.
Forsterman was no <i>shikari</i>, but he felt
himself called upon to uphold the cause of
science and the honour of England at this
juncture. In great agitation he went for
that feline,
and, in
short, its
skin and
its story were conspicuous attractions of
his cottage in the after years."</p>

<p>The perils which men
face in the search for
orchids are as great as
those encountered by the
prospector for precious
stones and metal, or by
the missionary
who goes forth
into the wild
corners of the
earth to preach
God's Word. We
know of one man
who, by pluck and
diplomacy, has
managed to pass unscathed among the
cannibals of New Guinea. When he
first arrived, he was
honoured by a careful
overhauling on the part
of the natives, who
ultimately declared that
he was too thin to eat.
He has since made himself
more or less at home
with them, though he
has only succeeded in
winning their esteem by
sitting down to the same
dish and partaking of its
contents, whatever they
might be, and in compelling
their respect by
placing a few inches of
cold steel at his side, and
giving them an occasional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">395</a></span>
object-lesson
in the wonders
of the revolver.
He carries
his life in his
hands, and all for
the sake of the
chance of finding
an orchid with
some feature possessed
by none
other. The collector
who would make
his mark must be prepared
for hazardous
marches, for hanging
like a sailor by his eyebrows
over mighty precipices,
or for wading for
days in swamps. He must have self-reliance,
resource, patience, knowledge,
and endurance.</p>

<p>The orchid has not only its heroes, it has
its martyrs as well. Any great grower will
give one the names of a dozen men who
have sacrificed all in their efforts to add to
the list of species. Collectors have been
lost in Panama, Rio Hacha, Ecuador,
Sierra Leone, Orinoco, and probably other
places. "I wonder," said a friend to Mr.
Burbidge, "if orchid amateurs ever give a
thought as to the real price their orchids
cost," and he proceeded to enumerate the
names of such men as Bruchmueller, Zahn,
Hutton, Klaboch,
Endres, Chesterton,
and Freeman, who have died in the interests
of the orchid lover. "On the roll of martyrs
to orchidology," says Mr. Boyle, with enthusiasm,
"Mr. Pearce stands high. To
him we owe, among many fine things, the
hybrid Begonias which are becoming such
favourites for bedding and other purposes....
It was his great luck and great honour
to find <i>Masdevallia Veitchii</i>, so long, so
often, so laboriously searched for from that
day to this, but never even heard of. To
collect another shipment of this glorious
orchid, Mr. Pearce sailed for Peru in the
service, I think, of Mr. Bull. Unhappily&mdash;for
us as well as for himself&mdash;he was
detained at Panama. Somewhere in those
parts there is a magnificent <i>Cypripedium</i>.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
The poor fellow could not resist this
temptation. They told him at Panama
that no white man had returned from the
spot, but he went on. The Indians
brought him back some days or weeks
later, without the prize; and he died on
arrival."</p>

<p>Even when the precious plant is secured,
and danger to life and limb is past, the
difficulties to be overcome are enormous.
To bring a million sterling in gold from
Paris or New York under special and
vigilant guard, is a process almost simple
when compared with the jealous care which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">396</a></span>
has to be expended on the transportation
of orchids. It sometimes
happens that on opening the cases
on arrival in England, a valuable
collection is found to have rotted
<i>en route</i>, and the importer realises
that hundreds of pounds
have been spent and lives
risked, to secure worthless
roots! The orchid importer
needs a stout heart
and unlimited enterprise,
and some of us may well wonder how
he manages to make the business
pay at all when we think of the
ambassadors he employs in nearly
every clime, of the funds which he has
occasionally to place at their disposal, and
of the fact that one loss may involve a sum
equal to a fair annual income. On the
other hand, if he is the lucky possessor of
a variety of value, the plant creates the
greatest enthusiasm in orchid circles, and
is consequently a source of immense profit.</p>

<p>We have in these pages taken a rapid
glance at the more popular, it may even be
said the more romantic, side of the work of
orchid collection. Enough has been said, we
hope, to show why the study of orchidology
is a liberal education. What a wealth
of natural history of the most fascinating
kind it opens up! Nothing more striking
is recorded in nature than the manner in
which the bee fertilises the orchid, to give
the least adequate account of which would
involve another half-dozen pages of this
magazine. The majority of us probably
would be surprised to learn that but few
orchids grow in the ground. They are
found often high up on the branches of
some monarch of the primeval forest, and
the proverbial needle in the bundle of hay
might be discovered half a dozen times over
whilst the collector is searching for a single
plant. Others appear, however, quite low
down. The tree-growing orchid is an epiphyte.
That is to say, though it lives on
the tree it makes the branch a resting-place
only. It gets its nourishment from the
atmosphere and not the tree, as does the
mistletoe for instance. One orchid, a <i>Diacrium</i>,
actually grows on rocks within reach
of the spray from the salt sea waves.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">ODONTOGLOSSUM CIRROSUM.</p></div>
</div>

<p>To follow in the footsteps of the collector
is to acquire a considerable knowledge
of the countries
of the
earth. Orchids
luxuriate in
warm and
humid places,
thousands of
feet above the
level of the
sea. They
have outdistanced
the
Anglo-Saxon
in the number
of lands
they have
colonised.
You may find
them in Africa,
in North,
Central, and
South America,
in Australia
and New Zealand, in Asia, in Madagascar,
in Europe&mdash;everywhere except
in very cold climates. One day the
orchid hunter may be on the high road
of civilisation, pursuing his quest like
an ordinary tourist; another he will have
plunged into regions dark as darkest Africa,
as far removed from modern conditions as
the dwarfs of Stanley's limitless forest. In
the search for a single orchid he comes
across many varieties of the human race,
and on a thousand points connected with
modes of life, of governments, of the
relations of places one to another, far and
near, he is better informed than many an
arm-chair specialist.</p>

<p class="a">N the fall of 1888 the steam-ship
<i>Sunda</i>, from Southampton,
was running along the
southern coast of Long Island,
not many hours from port,
when she was passed by one
of the great British liners, outward bound.
The tide was high, and the course of both
vessels was nearer the coast than is usual,
that of the <i>Sunda</i> being inside of the other.</p>

<p>As the two steamers passed each other
there was a great waving of hats and handkerchiefs.
Suddenly there was a scream
from the <i>Sunda</i>.
It came from
Signora Rochita,
the <i>prima donna</i>
of an opera
troupe which
was coming to
America in that
ship.</p>

<p>"I have lost
my bracelet!"
she cried in
Italian, and then,
turning to the
passengers, she
repeated the cry
in very good
English.</p>

<p>The situation
was instantly
comprehended
by everyone.
It was late in
the afternoon;
the captain had
given a grand
dinner to the
passengers, at
which the <i>prima
donna</i> had appeared
in all her
glories of ornamentation,
and
the greatest of these glories&mdash;a magnificent
diamond bracelet&mdash;was gone from
the arm with which she had been enthusiastically
waving her lace handkerchief.</p>

<p>The second officer, who was standing
near, dashed into the captain's office, and
quickly reappeared with chart and instruments,
and made a rapid calculation of the
position of the vessel at the time of the
accident, making due allowance for the few
minutes that had passed since the first cry
of the signora. After consultation with the
captain and re-calculations of the distance
from land and some other points, he announced
to the weeping signora that her
bracelet lay under a little black spot he
made on the chart, and that if she chose to
send a diver for it she might get it, for the
depth of water at that place was not great.</p>

<p>By profession I am a diver, and the next
day I was engaged
to search
for the diamond
bracelet of Signora
Rochita. I
had a copy of
the chart, and
having hired a
small schooner,
with several men
who had been
my assistants
before, and taking
with me all
the necessary accoutrements
and
appliances, I set
out for the spot
indicated, and
by afternoon we
were anchored,
we believed, at
it or very near
it.</p>

<p>I lost no time
in descending.
I wore, of course,
the usual diver's
suit, but I took
with me no
tools nor any of
the implements
used by divers
when examining wrecks; but I carried in
my right hand a brilliant electric lamp,
connected with a powerful battery on the
schooner. I held this by an insulated
handle, in which there were two little
knobs, by which I could light or extinguish
it.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/scan397-2.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">"WAVING HER LACE HANDKERCHIEF."</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">398</a></span></p>

<p>The bottom was hard and smooth, and
lighting my lamp, I began to look about me.
If I approached the bracelet I ought to be
able to see it sparkle, but after wandering
over considerable space, I saw no sparkles
nor anything like a bracelet. Suddenly,
however, I saw something which greatly
interested me. It was a hole in the bottom
of the ocean, almost circular, and at the
least ten feet in diameter. I was surprised
that I had not noticed it before, for it lay
not far from the stern of our vessel.</p>

<p>Standing near the rocky edge of the
aperture, I held out my lamp and looked
down. Not far below I saw the glimmering
of what seemed to be the bottom of this
subterranean well. I was seized with a
desire to explore this
great hole running down
under the ordinary bottom
of the sea. I signalled to
be lowered, and although
my comrades were much
surprised at such an order,
they obeyed, and down I
went into the well. The
sides of this seemed rocky
and almost perpendicular,
but after descending about
fifteen feet, they receded
on every side, and I
found myself going down
into a wide cavern, the
floor of which I touched in
a very short time.</p>

<p>Holding up my lamp,
and looking about me, I
found myself in a sea cave
of some thirty feet in
diameter, with a domelike
roof, in which, a little to
one side of the centre, was
the lower opening of the
well. I became very
much excited; this was
just the sort of place into
which a bracelet or anything
else of value might
be expected to have the
bad luck to drop. I walked
about and gazed everywhere,
but I found nothing
but rocks and water.</p>

<p>I was about to signal
to be drawn up, when
above me I saw what appeared to be
a flash of darkness, coming down through
the well. With a rush and a swirl it
entered the cavern, and in a moment I
recognised the fact that a great fish was
swooping around and about me. Its movements
were so rapid and irregular, now
circling along the outer edge of the floor of
the cavern, then mounting above me, until
its back seemed to scrape the roof, that I
could not form a correct idea of the size of
the creature. It seemed to me to be at least
twenty feet long. I stood almost stupefied,
keeping my eyes as far as possible fixed
upon the swiftly moving monster.</p>

<p>Sometimes he came quite near me, when
I shuddered in every fibre, and then he shot
away, but ever gliding with powerful undulations
of his body and tail, around, about,
and above me. I did not dare to signal to
be drawn up, for fear that the terrible
creature would enter
the well-hole with
me. Then he would
probably touch me,
perhaps crush me
against the wall, but
my mind was capable
of forming no plans;
I only hoped the fish
would ascend and disappear
by the way he
came.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/scan398.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">"I STOOD STUPEFIED."</p></div>
</div>

<p>My mind was not
in its strongest condition,
being much upset by a great
trouble, and I was so frightened that I
really did not know what I ought to do, but
I had sense enough left to feel sure that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">399</a></span>
fish had been attracted into the cavern by my
lamp. Obviously the right thing to do was
to extinguish it, but the very thought of
this nearly drove me into a frenzy. I could
not endure to be left alone with the shark
in darkness and water. It was an insane
idea, but I felt that, whatever happened, I
must keep my eyes upon him.</p>

<p>Now the great fish began to swoop
nearer and nearer to me, and then suddenly
changing its tactics, it receded to the
most distant wall of the cavern, where,
with its head toward me, it remained for
the first time motionless. But this did
not continue long. Gently turning over
on its side, it opened its great mouth, and
in an instant, with a rush, it came directly
at me. My light shone full into its vast
mouth, glistening with teeth, there was a
violent jerk which nearly threw me off my
feet, and all was blackness. The shark had
swallowed my lamp! By rare good fortune
he did not take my hand also.</p>

<p>Now I frantically tugged at my signal
rope. Without my lamp, I had no
thought but a desire to be pulled out of
the water, no matter what happened. In
a few minutes I sat divested of my diving
suit, and almost insensible upon the deck
of the schooner. As soon as I was able to
talk I told my astonished comrades what
had happened, and while we were discussing
this strange occurrence, one of them,
looking over the side, saw, slowly rising to
the surface, the body of a dead shark.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/scan399.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">"IT WAS A PINT BOTTLE."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"By George!" he cried, "here is the
beast. He has been killed by the current
from the battery." We all crowded to the
rail, and looked down upon the monster.
He was about ten feet long, and it was
plain that he had died for making himself
the connection between the poles of the
battery.</p>

<p>"Well," said the captain, presently, "I
suppose you are not going down again?"</p>

<p>"Not I," I replied; "I give up this
job."</p>

<p>Then suddenly I cried, "Come, boys, all
of you, make fast to that shark, and get
him on board; I want him."</p>

<p>Some of the men laughed, but my
manner was so earnest, that in a moment
they all set about to help me. A small
boat was lowered, lines were made fast to
the dead fish, and, with block and tackle, we
hauled him on deck. I then got a
butcher's knife from the cabin, and began
to cut him open.</p>

<p>"Look here, Tom!" exclaimed the
captain, "that's nonsense. Your lamp's
all smashed to pieces, and if you get it out
it will never be any good to you."</p>

<p>"I don't care for the lamp," I answered,
working away energetically, "but an idea
has struck me. It's plain that this creature
had a fancy for shining things. If he
swallowed a
lamp, there is no
reason why he
should not have
swallowed anything
else that
glistened."</p>

<p>"Oh-o!"
cried the captain,
"you think he
swallowed the
bracelet, do
you?"</p>

<p>And instantly
everybody
crowded more
closely about me.</p>

<p>I got out the
lamp&mdash;its wires
were severed as
smoothly as if
they had been
cut with shears;
then I worked
on. Suddenly
there was a cry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">400</a></span>
from every man. Something glimmered
in the dark interior of the fish. I
grasped it and drew it out. It was not
a bracelet, but a pint bottle, which
glimmered like a glow-worm. With the
bottle in my hand I sat upon the deck and
gazed at it. I shook it; it shone brighter.
A bit of oiled silk was tied tightly over the
cork, and it was plain to see that it was
partly filled with a light coloured oil, into
which a bit of phosphorus had been dropped,
which on being agitated filled the bottle
with a dim light.</p>

<p>But there was something more in the
bottle than phosphorus and oil. I saw a tin
tube corked at each end; the exposed parts
of the corks spreading enough to prevent
the tin from striking the glass. We all
knew that this was one of those bottles
containing a communication of some sort;
which are often thrown into the sea, and
float about until they are picked up. The
addition of the oil and phosphorus was
intended to make it visible by night as well
as by day, and this was plainly the reason
why it had been swallowed by a light
loving shark.</p>

<p>I poured out the oil and extracted the
tube. Wiping it carefully I drew out the
corks, and then from the little tin cylinder
I pulled a half-sheet of note-paper, rolled
up tightly. I unrolled it, and read these
words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Before I jump overboard, I want to let
people know that I killed John Polhemus.
So I have fixed up this bottle. I hope it
may be picked up in time to keep Jim
Barker from being hung. I did think of
leaving it on the steamer, but I might
change my mind about jumping overboard,
and I guess this is the best way. The
clothes I wore, and the hatchet I did it
with, are under the wood shed back of
Polhemus' house.</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Henry Ramsey.</span>"<br />
</p>

<p>I sprang to my feet with a yell. Jim
Barker was my brother, now lying in prison
under sentence of death for the murder of
Polhemus. All the circumstantial evidence,
and there was no other, had been against
him. The note was dated eight months
back. Oh! cruel fool of a murderer. The
shark was thrown overboard, and we made
best speed to port, and, before the end of
the afternoon I had put Ramsey's note into
the hands of the lawyer who had charge of
my brother's case.</p>

<p>Fortunately, he was able to identify the
handwriting and signature of Ramsey, a
man who had been suspected of the crime,
but against whom no evidence could be
found. The lawyer was almost as excited
as I was by the contents of this note, and
early the next morning we started together
for the house of the Polhemus' family.
There under the wood shed we found, carefully
buried, a blood-stained shirt and vest
and the hatchet.</p>

<p>My impulse was to fly to my brother, but
this my lawyer forbade. He would take
charge of the affair, and no false hopes
must be excited, but he confidently assured
me that my brother was as good as free.</p>

<p>Returning to the city I thought I might
as well make my report to Signora Rochita.
The lady was at home and saw me. She
showed the most intense interest in what I
told her, and insisted upon every detail of
my experiences. As I spoke of the shark
and the subterranean cave she nearly fainted
from excitement, and her maid had to bring
the smelling salts. When I had finished
she looked at me steadily for a moment,
and then said:</p>

<p>"I have something to tell you, but I
hardly know how to say it. I never lost
my bracelet. I intended to wear it at the
captain's dinner; but when I went to put
it on I found the clasp was broken, and, as
I was late, I hurried to the table without
the bracelet, and thought of it no more
until, when we were all waving and cheering,
I glanced at my wrist and found it was
not there. Then, utterly forgetting that I
had not put it on, I thought it had gone
into the sea. It was only this morning,
that, opening what I supposed was the
empty box, I saw it. Here it is."</p>

<p>I never saw such gorgeous jewels.</p>

<p>"Madam," said I, "I am glad you
thought you lost it, for I have gained something
better than all these."</p>

<p>"You are a good man," said she, and
then she paid me liberally for my services.
When this business had been finished, she
asked&mdash;</p>

<p>"Are you married?"</p>

<p>I answered that I was not.</p>

<p>"Is there anyone you intend to marry?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said I.</p>

<p>"What is her name?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Sarah Jane McElroy."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," said she, and she retired
into another room. Presently she
returned and handed me a little box.</p>

<p>"Give this to your lady-love," said she;
"when she looks at it she will never forget
that you are a brave man."</p>

<p>When Sarah Jane opened the box, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">401</a></span>
was a little pin with a diamond head, and
she gave a scream of delight. But I saw no
reason for jumping or crying out, for, after
having seen the Signora's bracelet, this
stone seemed like a pea in a bushel of
potatoes.</p>

<p>"I don't need anything," she said, "to
remind me you are a brave man. I am
going to buy furniture with it."</p>

<p>I laughed, and remarked that "every
little helps."</p>

<p>When I sit, with my wife by my side,
before the fire in our comfortable home,
and consider that the parlour carpet, and
the furniture, and the pictures, and the hall
and stair carpet, and all the dining-room
furniture, with the china and the glass and
the linen, and all the kitchen utensils, and
two bedroom suites on the second story&mdash;both
hard wood&mdash;and all the furniture and
fittings of a very pleasant room for a single
man, the third story front, were bought
with the pin that the Signora gave to Sarah
Jane, I am filled with profound respect for
things that glitter. And when I look on
the other side of the fire and see Jim
smoking his pipe just as happy as anybody,
then I say to myself that, if there are people
who think that this story is too much out
of the common, I wish they would step in
here and talk to Jim about it. There is a
fire in his eye when he tells you how glad
he is that it was the shark that died instead
of him.</p>

<p class="a">vivid public interest has of
late been aroused in regard to
the administration of justice
in this country. The wholesome
feeling of reverence that
formerly attached to our
judges seems now to be on the wane, and in
private circles, especially among the legal
profession, the conduct of the judicature has
been severely commented upon, while the
Press has occasionally ventured to darkly
hint that the retirement of one of our most
eminent judges is desirable in the public
interest. On all sides it is agreed that his
infirmities unfit him for the efficient discharge
of his duties, his judgments show
the melancholy decline of a once brilliant
intellect, and the continued occupation of
his seat upon the bench is a source of
danger to the public. And yet such is the
state of our legal machinery that his retirement
is practically in his own hands. Only
by an address of both Houses of Parliament
to the Crown can his removal be brought
about&mdash;an odious and invidious task, which
the legislature naturally delays as long as
possible, and will only undertake as an
extreme measure. Although of recent
years there has been a marked improvement
in the <i>personnel</i> of our judges, so far as
bodily vigour is concerned, there are still
on the bench aged and infirm men who
would have retired but for the necessity of
completing the statutory period of fifteen
years, at the expiration of which only can
their pensions be earned. It is pitiable to
see these old public servants, who once
ranked among the most brilliant men of
their day, attempting to discharge their
duties with an obvious effort and at great
physical fatigue.</p>

<p>More than enough instances have recently
arisen of judges being incapacitated by
deafness and other infirmities, and refusing
to retire. But public opinion has hitherto
been very tolerant, and these distinguished
men have been permitted in their declining
years to exercise functions demanding the
highest mental activity without exciting
adverse comment. That there are defects
in our judicial system, not the least of
which is the absence of any controlling
power over our judges, becomes more and
more apparent, and it will be useful, therefore,
to bring some of those which are
most notorious in the legal profession
under the notice of the public.</p>

<p>The judicial system in this country is the
most expensive in the world. Our judges,
it is true, are men of the highest integrity,
and the confidence of the public in their incorruptibility
is absolute. In this respect,
no doubt, we compare favourably with
many foreign nations. But the public have
a right to look for something more than a
strictly honourable bench, and it is desirable
to inquire what we get in return for the
enormous annual outlay on our judicature.
For the sake of convenience let us begin
with the higher tribunals. It will be interesting,
in the first place, to study the

<p>There are, besides, a great number of
highly paid officials known on the Common
Law side as masters, and in the Chancery
Division as chief clerks, who assist the
judges by performing minor judicial
functions. These gentlemen receive &#163;1,000
a year each. There are also Clerks of the
Crown and Associates on the various circuits
who receive liberal salaries, as well as
a multitude of clerks and other officers who
are paid out of the public funds. But it is
not our present purpose to consider these
minor functionaries, our object being to
afford a general conception of the working
of the High Courts of Justice without
going into unnecessary details. For the
information of the curious, however, we
may state that the total expenditure for
law and justice last year was more than
four and a half millions sterling, a sum
which it should be understood includes the
charges for maintaining prisons and other
expenses incidental to the administration of
justice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">403</a></span></p>

<p>In face of such stupendous figures the
intelligent foreigner may well imagine
that we have a judicial system well-nigh
perfect, or at least quite adequate to the
requirements of a great commercial community.
And yet what are the facts?
Among members of the legal profession it
is a matter of common observation and
lament that commercial cases are year by
year growing less frequent. For a long
time they consoled
themselves by attributing
this to
commercial stagnation.
But of late
their eyes have been
opened to the real
cause, and neither
by their smiles nor
their tears can they
win back the vanished
litigation that
once so satisfactorily
brought grist to their
mill. On all hands
business men declare
that, so far from
being satisfied with
their expensive legal
machinery, they absolutely
dread the
law. They dare not
risk its dignified
delay, they fear its
endless expense, they
are terrified at the prospect of being dragged
from Court to Court on Appeal, and they
have no confidence in the ability of a large
proportion of our judges to decide rightly
on commercial disputes, especially those
involving technical matters.</p>

</div>

<p>This feeling has doubtless been intensified
by the recent case of Vagliano and the Bank
of England. It is needless to go into the
details of this matter, which are well known
to the public. Suffice it to say that a judge
of the High Court in 1888 gave a decision
contrary to the feeling of business men and
subversive of commercial custom in regard
to bills of exchange, which was upheld in
the Court of Appeal by a majority of five to
one. This decision was, however, reversed
in the House of Lords in March of this year
by a majority of six to two. Thus, after
long delay and enormous expense, the case
having been heard by fifteen judges, a final
decision was obtained that satisfied the
commercial community. But the uncertainty
of the law is exemplified by the fact
that the verdict of seven judges, <i>i.e.</i>, six in
the House of Lords and one in the Court of
Appeal, outweighed that of the remaining
eight. And there is no reason to suppose
that the judges of the House of Lords who
carried the day are men of higher legal
ability than those in the Court of Appeal.</p>

<p>Instead, therefore, of waiting months
for their cases to be tried, paying enormous
fees to leading counsel, and possibly enduring
the risk and
delay of appeal, men
of commerce prefer
to submit their disputes
to the arbitration
of others in
their own trade, and
thereby get them
decided without any
delay or legal expense.
Innumerable
disputes are in this
way settled in the
City every year, and
in some businesses
it is a matter of
etiquette for men to
accept the office
of arbitrator when
asked to do so without
any fee, they
knowing full well
that the time is sure
to come when they
themselves will require
to have a matter decided in the same
convenient and expeditious manner.</p>

<p>It is undoubtedly a great hardship for a
commercial community to have to put up
with rough and ready justice in this way,
instead of having the advantage of highly
trained legal minds. But business men
cannot afford to wait for the slow machinery
of the law, and though they have to
maintain the Courts of Justice, they decide
to do without them. Doubtless many others
would gladly do the same had they equal
facilities for arbitration.</p>

<p>The result of this widening breach between
law and commerce is that a large
and increasing proportion of the work of the
High Court consists of libel, slander, malicious
prosecution, and cases of a similar
class, together with actions varying in character
not at all, and in the amount sought
to be recovered only infinitesimally, from
those which come within the jurisdiction of
the County Court.</p>

<p>But though a great number of the suits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">404</a></span>
may be of slight importance, the cost of litigation
is by no means insignificant. The
court-fees, it is true, are not proportionately
so high as in the County Court, although
they might with advantage be largely reduced;
but the average charges for legal
assistance are enough to make the boldest
litigant pause.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/scan404.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">APPEAL COURT.</p></div>
</div>

<p>In an ordinary action for &#163;100, supposing
the defendant to be unsuccessful, he
will probably have to pay, in addition to
the &#163;100, not less than &#163;120 to his opponents'
solicitor for the costs taxed against
him, as well as, say, &#163;150, the little account
of his own attorney. Supposing he conscientiously
believes the verdict to be unjust, and
determines to go to the Court of Appeal,
he will have to pay at least &#163;100 more if
unsuccessful. This brings his bill up to
&#163;470, instead of the original &#163;100. A
rational litigant would in such a case be
unlikely to want to go beyond the Court of
Appeal, but supposing he should desire to
avail himself of the highest tribunal that a
generous country places at his disposal, and
takes his case to the House of Lords, he
will be put to a further expense of about
&#163;200.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the successful suitor
would also be at a considerable loss, the
costs that he would have to pay being far
in excess of the &#163;100 recovered. By such
a system a powerful and dangerous weapon
is undoubtedly placed in the hands of a
wealthy litigant who chooses oppressively
to take his opponent from court to court.
In many cases the costs are augmented to
a scandalous degree by the multiplication
of interlocutory proceedings. It is monstrous
that in an action to recover a sum
of &#163;100 a wealthy and perverse litigant
should have the power, on some incidental
question of interrogatory, to take his
opponent from the master to the judge,
from the judge to the Divisional Court,
from the Divisional Court to the Court of
Appeal, and from the Court of Appeal to
the House of Lords.</p>

<p>An evil hardly less grave than the law's
expense is the law's delay. In a common
law action of the simplest character, with
little or no interlocutory proceedings, the
period that must elapse between the issue
of the writ and the trial of the action is
little short of twelve months, while in the
event of appeal nearly another year will be
lost. In the Chancery Division the delay
is still more marked.</p>

<p>At the commencement of the legal year,
namely, October 24, 1890, there were 448
Chancery cases set down for trial. Of these,
when Christmas arrived, only 74 had been
decided, that is, after about one-third of the
judicial year had elapsed. At that rate of
progress&mdash;without allowing for the setting
down of additional causes, which is, of
course, continuous throughout the year&mdash;there
would only be, of the 448 causes set
down in October, 1890, 222 disposed of by
October, 1891, thus leaving still unsettled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">405</a></span>
half the cases that litigants were ready to
try twelve months before.</p>

<p>The appointment of an additional Chancery
judge is by many advocated for the
purpose of battling with these arrears. It
is, however, notorious that, owing to the
higher scale of costs in Chancery than in
Common Law, solicitors prefer the former
for the purpose of trying their actions. In
consequence of this, a large number of
cases that should properly come before the
Common Law judges are tried in the Chancery
Division. Surely the effect of removing
this gross anomaly should be seen before
further expenditure be imposed upon the
nation.</p>

<p>Few probably will go so far as Jeremy
Bentham in laying down that the State
should provide for the administration of
justice free of expense to litigants; but
there is a very general consensus of opinion
in favour of a simplification of procedure
and a limitation of the powers of appeal,
and these are reforms that a willing legislature
might well undertake.</p>

<p>To return to the judges of the High
Court, it will be instructive to inquire how
they earn the liberal salaries set forth in
the foregoing table. Commencing at the
top, it will be well to consider the position
of that august official the Lord High Chancellor
of England. And whatever remarks
we may find it necessary to make,
we wish it to be distinctly understood that
we mean no disrespect to Lord Halsbury,
the present learned and capable occupant
of the post. It
is merely our object
to criticise
the office, and
our observations,
therefore, will
have no personal
bearing. In the
first place, it is
worthy of note
that the most
highly paid temporal
office in
England&mdash;that
of the Lord Chancellor&mdash;is
given
rather as a reward
for political
than for legal success.
Of course,
to occupy the
post of Attorney-General,
the stepping-stone
to that of Lord Chancellor, a man
must be a lawyer of considerable ability.
It has, however, been very well said that a
good lawyer can be nothing else; and it is
obvious that an Attorney-General must be
a man of some political as well as legal
capacity. It is quite conceivable that there
may be a dearth of legal talent on any political
side, and that a moderate man maybe
chosen as the chief law-adviser of the
Crown in consequence. Indeed, such a
state of things has happened before now.
It by no means follows, therefore, that the
Lord Chancellor is necessarily a man of
transcendent legal ability. It is probable,
in fact, that, as a rule, he is not so good a
lawyer as the judges who receive half his
salary. And here it may be well to remark
that, although the Lord Chancellor is
nominally at the head of the bench, he
can exercise no efficient control over the
judges. He can make appointments to the
bench, but judges, once made, can, as
already stated, only be removed by the act
of both Houses of Parliament. Thus a
judge, even if obviously suffering from
mental decay, may continue to exercise his
functions, to the miscarriage of justice, for
a considerable period before the legislature
can be set in motion to bring about his
retirement.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/scan405.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">MR. JUSTICE JEUNE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The Lord Chancellor occasionally (when
any of the Lords Justices are absent from
illness or other cause) sits in the Court of
Appeal, which is held in two sections&mdash;one
hearing cases from the Common Law side,
and the other
those from the
Chancery Division.
The principal
duty of the
Lord Chancellor,
however, consists
in presiding over
the House of
Lords&mdash;the final
Court of Appeal
both in Common
Law and Chancery
matters. The
House of Lords,
as an appellate
court, consists of
the Lord Chancellor,
the Lords
of Appeal, and
such peers as are,
or have been,
holding high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">406</a></span>
judicial office. Ordinary peers, however,
have also the right of sitting and giving
judgment, and, in consequence of this
anomaly, the judges of final appeal have
sometimes had the assistance of an eccentric
nobleman endowed with a fancy for the
law, whose vote has carried as much weight
as that of the Lord Chancellor himself.
The judicial work of the House of Lords is
light. Indeed, it will not be understating
the case to say that the House does not
dispose of more
than sixty or
seventy causes in
the year. It is
thus not difficult
to calculate, supposing
these cases
to occupy an average
of half a day,
and taking into
consideration the
salaries of the
Lord Chancellor
and the Lords of
Appeal, together
with the heavy
pensions paid to
ex-Chancellors
and other expenses,
that the
Court of Final
Appeal exercises
its judicial functions at a cost of something
like a thousand pounds a day!</p>

<p>Besides the Lord Chancellor, the Lord
Chief Justice is by some legal fiction supposed
to exercise control over the judicial
bench. As a matter of fact, however, the
judges are practically under no control
whatever save that of public opinion, as
represented by the press, which should
never hesitate to expose their shortcomings
when they come to light. It is the duty of
those on whom, by force of circumstances,
the public are obliged to rely to safeguard
their interests, not to relax their supervision
out of deference to the high repute
in which our judges are held. Under the
old system, when the Courts of Common
Pleas, Exchequer, and Queen's Bench
existed, each division had a chief who was
responsible for the work of his court and
the mode in which it was administered.
The judges now hold a meeting, at which
they make their own arrangements for
circuits and for appointments to the various
courts. Although the Lord Chief Justice
is supposed to control the order of work,
the judges in effect have a free hand as
regards their own duties.</p>

<p>With the development of modern civilisation
and the increase of democratic strength,
the social status of the judges has materially
changed, and it is by no means in accordance
with "end of the century" ideas to
grant them the almost despotic power that
they held of old.</p>

<p>The Judicature Act did something towards
diminishing their prestige, and nowadays
many of them are disappointed perhaps to
find that their office does not command a
high social position.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/scan406.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">ADMIRALTY COURT.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Notwithstanding the decadence of the
social status and prestige of the judges, on
circuit they maintain a pomp and splendour,
it is true somewhat tawdry, which finds its
only counterpart in the mimic state of the
Lord Mayor. Quiet gentlemen who have
been accustomed all their lives to carry
their own bags down to chambers, suddenly
find themselves, after being raised to the
Bench and especially when going on circuit,
surrounded with unwonted splendour. They
are attended by a smart young gentleman
who costs the country three guineas a day
while the Assizes last, as his reward for
acting as judge's marshal, or a sort of groom-in-waiting.
If he fulfilled the functions of
clerk, perhaps there would not be much
cause for complaint; but the judge has a
clerk of his own, to whom the nation pays
a liberal salary, and the marshal's duties
are purely ornamental.</p>

<p>It is true the cost of the splendid equipage,
generally drawn by four hack horses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">407</a></span>
from the local livery stables, the trumpeters,
the javelin men, and all the paraphernalia
of the judge's progress from his lodgings to
the Court, falls upon the High Sheriff, and
not upon the country; but it is, nevertheless,
a vexatious impost and an intolerable
anachronism.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/scan407-1.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">HATS AND WIGS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The prerogatives of the judges still far
exceed those of any other public servants;
they are permitted to perform their duties
almost at their own pleasure; even the
Legislature refuses to recognise any power
over them, and they have also much
patronage vested in them, such as the
appointment of revising barristers, chief
clerks and masters, who exercise judicial
functions.</p>

<p>The holidays enjoyed by the members of
the judicature are far in excess of those in
any other profession.</p>

<p>The following figures will give an idea of
how many days out of the 365 are occupied
by the judges in earning their salaries:&mdash;</p>

<p>Although there is no statutory authority
for the closing of the courts on the Queen's
birthday, the judges have recently, with one
or two exceptions, made a point of showing
their loyalty by doing no work on that day.
Many of them also are
frequently absent on
ordinary working days
from other causes than
illness. These delinquents
are well known
to the members of the
legal profession, and it
is unnecessary to mention
their names.</p>

<p>The hours of sitting
are nominally from
10.30 in the morning
to 4 in the afternoon,
with an interval of
half an hour for lunch.
Some judges, however,
do not generally take
their seats until a
quarter to 11, and often
later, and one or two
are known occasionally
to steal a little time
from the end of the sitting. It is also a
matter of common observation that the
orthodox half-hour for lunch is very often
spun out to three-quarters. So that, including
the short sitting on Saturdays,
when the courts rise at two o'clock, the
judges do not sit much more than an
average of four hours a day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">408</a></span></p>

<p>Even if we give them credit for 4-1/2 hours
a day, reckoning their salaries at &#163;5,000
(though many of them receive more) we
find that the payment they receive for their
work comes to over &#163;5 an hour. At such
a price it is only reasonable to expect them
to give the fullest attention to their duties.
But, alas, for human fallibility! Even
judges sometimes nod.</p>

<p>It is true that our system is at fault in
permitting our judicature to be conducted
by men whose physical infirmities prevent
them from giving due attention to their
work. But such considerations do not
soothe the breast of the unfortunate litigant
who has paid an eminent counsel a hundred
guineas to address a sleeping judge, or one
whose deafness prevents him from comprehending
the weighty arguments offered for
his consideration.</p>

<div class="figleft">

<div class="caption"><p class="center">A MESSENGER.</p></div>
</div>

<p>It is part of the duty of the fourteen
judges of the Queen's Bench Division to
go on circuit, and during the time of the
circuits, as a rule not more than two or
three puisne judges are left in London.
These judges are absent from town, in fact,
fully one-half of the judicial year, and the
occupants of the bench are not in the
metropolis in their full strength for more
than a third of that period. As a result of
this arrangement, the business of the high
courts, so far as the trial of actions is concerned,
is absolutely at a stand-still during
the greater part of the year. The cause
lists become congested, suitors wait vainly
for their cases to be settled, and a multitude
of the suits entered never come on for trial
at all, many of them being more or less
amicably arranged out of court, while others
bring about their own culmination through
death or other causes. It is notorious that
many of the judges, when they observe that
a case is of a complex character, involving
long and tedious investigation, will bring
strong pressure on the
parties to induce them
either to settle the case or
to refer it to an arbitrator.
Such pressure it is dangerous
for either side to
resist, and it results in
further fees, further costs,
and further delay.</p>

<p>The judges, while on
circuit, receive a travelling
allowance of seven
guineas a day. This is a
comparatively recent arrangement,
the travelling
expenses having formerly
been paid in a lump sum.
It would be interesting
to compare the average
length of time occupied
by the judges on circuit
under the old and under
the new system. A great
deal of time is utterly
wasted. For instance, a
whole day is devoted to
what is termed "Opening
the Commission." This is nothing but an
antiquated ceremony of no possible use,
consisting of the reading of the Royal
Commission under which the judges hold
the assizes. It occupies about a quarter of
an hour, the remainder of the day being
lost. The assizes are often concluded
within a less number of days than the
time assigned to them, and the judges
take advantage of this to enjoy a welcome
holiday, with a solatium for their enforced
idleness of seven guineas a day.</p>

<p>Our present circuit system undoubtedly
leads to a scandalous and deplorable waste
of judicial time and public money. For
instance, on the South-Eastern Circuit, the
largest towns of which are Cambridge and
Norwich, there is practically no business
whatever; and yet all the paraphernalia
and expense of assizes goes on for eleven or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">409</a></span>
twelve weeks every year in respect of cases
that might be disposed of in London in
about a week by one judge. On other circuits,
too, time is wasted in an equally
reckless manner, the judges on several days
being absolutely idle.</p>

<p>Surely there is no necessity to allow a
week for the judicial work at a town where
there are only a few cases that could easily
be disposed of in a couple of days. The
public, who pay the bill, unfortunately
have but little opportunity of having the
shortcomings of the judges brought under
their notice. Not only are the latter protected
by the respectful feeling, the result
of ingrained reverence, that the judicial
bench has always been able to inspire; but
it is also a fact that those whose position
makes them most capable of criticising the
judges find it contrary to their interests to
do so. Barristers who have to make their
way at the bar, and who are well acquainted
with the peculiarities of the judges, are
afraid to speak of them, for to do so would
be to their own professional detriment, and
clerks and underlings, who have to rely on
the patronage of the judges, cannot be expected
to tell what they know.</p>

<p>In the present article it is to be hoped
we have done enough to show that defects
exist, and that one of the most needed
reforms is the establishment of a complete
and efficient controlling power over our
judicial bench, for judges, after all, are only
human, and no human beings, however
honourable, can be relied upon always to
perform their duty to the public with
thoroughness and energy if left entirely to
their own devices.</p>

<p>The fact that private arbitration, especially
in commercial cases, has in a great measure
superseded the Courts, forms a most
damaging comment on our judicial system.
The case, then, that we allege against the
judicature may be briefly summed up, the
chief points being as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Excessive cost.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Unreasonable delay in getting to trial.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Unnecessary multiplication of appeals
with consequent delay and expense.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Waste of judicial power on Circuit and
Divisional Court arrangements.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) Incapacity of individual judges.</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) Unreasonably long holidays.</p>

<p>It is our intention in subsequent articles
to bring forward further particulars, and
without going so deeply into technical
details as to be uninteresting to the ordinary
reader, to suggest remedies with a view to
bringing our judicature more in touch with
the people, and making it adequate to the
needs of a great commercial community.</p>

<p class="a">HOUGH military surgeons
are technically non-combatants,
yet practically they are
as much exposed to peril as
other officers, and frequently
have to perform work demanding
the greatest care and calmness
under the most disturbing dangers. In
gallantry and devotion to duty no other
class of soldiers has surpassed them. The
following is the story of the exploit of one
of these brave men, Surgeon Jee, as told
in his own words:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On the advance of the force to relieve
the garrison of Lucknow, under Generals
Havelock and Outram, my regiment, the
78th Highlanders, led the way. General
Outram's order on leaving Lucknow ran as
follows:&mdash;"I have
selected the 78th
Highlanders for
covering the retreat
of the force;
they had the post
of honour on the
advance, and
none are more
worthy of the
post of honour
on leaving it."</p>

<p>There was very
hard fighting
from the Alum
Bagh till we
arrived close to
Lucknow, when
I was told an
officer was severely
wounded. I
dismounted from
my horse to attend
him, and
found he was
dead. At that
moment a very
rapid ordnance
and musketry fire
commenced close
to us, and I was pulled into the bastioned
gateway of the Char-Bagh Palace by some
soldiers, to whom probably I owed my life,
as the round shot passed by us in quick
succession. Captain Havelock (now Sir
Henry Havelock) then rode up to me, with
a bullet hole through his topee, and said,
"We have taken that position, at all events,
at the point of the bayonet." That proved to
be the bridge over the canal at the entrance
of Lucknow, defended by heavy guns, which
had evidently been well served, judging by
the numbers of dead lying around them.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/scan410-2.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">SURGEON JEE DRESSING THE WOUNDED.</p></div>
</div>

<p>When the main body of the force arrived
and crossed to the other side of the bridge,
the Generals heard that the streets in the
city, leading direct to the Residency, were
entrenched and barricaded. It was, therefore,
decided to take the outside route by
the very narrow road to the right by the
canal, leaving the 78th to hold the position
until ordered to advance after the column.
Captains Drummond-Hay and Lockhart
were then ordered to proceed with their
companies to a pagoda some little distance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">411</a></span>up the street leading from the bridge. All
was pretty quiet for some time, and the
force had got some distance away, when a
message was sent down to the Colonel by
Captain Drummond-Hay that the enemy
were coming down upon them in great
force with two guns. The Colonel sent
up an order for them to charge them,
which they did, and spiked the guns and
brought them down and threw them into
the canal, all the while hotly pursued by
the enemy. I then got between twenty
and thirty wounded men in a few minutes.</p>

<p>I was then informed that the regiment had
disappeared round the corner of the canal
after the force, and that we should all be
killed if I remained to dress the wounded
upon whom I was engaged, as the enemy
was firing at us from the corner of the
street. So I sent to the Colonel for men
to carry the wounded on their backs till we
came up with the dhoolies. I was thus
enabled to save them for a short time. It
appeared that Captain Havelock, the
Assistant Adjutant-General, had been sent
back by his father to order the 78th to
follow the force, when he was badly
wounded in his arm. Luckily I came
across two dhoolies, in which I placed him
and a lieutenant of the 78th, who was
mortally wounded. The rest I put into
sick-carts drawn by six bullocks; but shortly
after all of them were massacred within
sight of us, as unfortunately a native
hackery containing round shot fell over,
and completely blocked the road. One
poor fellow, Private Farmer, held his watch
out from one of the carts, asking his comrades
to come and take it rather than the
enemy should get it, but no one responded,
as the danger was too great.</p>

<p>One man had his lower jaw blown off by
a round shot, whom I am seen dressing in
my V.C. picture at the Crystal Palace.</p>

<p>When we reached the force Captain
Halliburton, 78th Highlanders (afterwards
killed in Lucknow), took charge of the
wounded with his company. We lost our
way in the city, and were led by a guide,
who showed us the way to the Residency
into the enemy's battery, where we suffered
considerable loss. After this we
wandered about the suburbs of the city,
under an awful cannonading and shelling
from the opposite side of the River Goomtee,
being fired at from loopholes in the houses
of the streets when we entered them, from
which parties of natives, clothed in white,
often issued. We took refuge in the Mote-Mahul,
as it was too late at night to
advance further. The Mote-Mahul is a
square courtyard with sheds round it, and
two large gateway entrances. This was
crowded with soldiers, camp followers, and
camels, so that you could scarcely move. I
had Captain Havelock and Lieutenant
Woodhouse (right arm afterwards amputated),
84th Regiment, with me under the
shed. The firing during the night was
deafening, and gongs were sounding the
hour, and we knew not how far the Residency
was. Some who had been with the
main body said the 78th were all killed, and
they could not tell what had become of the
rest of the force. At daylight the next day
Brigadier Cooper gave us some tea, as we had
taken nothing since leaving Alum Bagh early
the morning before. Our men then commenced
making loopholes in the wall of
the shed to shoot the enemy on the other
side, and I heard them told not to make
too many or they would be shooting some
of us, and soon afterwards Brigadier Cooper
was shot through one of them, and fell
over me. I often had to cross a gateway
that was being raked up by bullets, to dress
the wounded of both the artillery and my
own men, against the remonstrances of my
apothecary, Mr. de Soura, and others.</p>

<p>I then volunteered to attempt to get the
wounded into the Residency, and was told
by Captain Halliburton, if I succeeded, to
tell General Outram to send him reinforcements
or they would all be killed and the
guns lost. I soon came across Colonel
Campbell, wounded in the leg (afterwards
amputated in Lucknow, and he died), and I
got one of his men to carry him on his
back (who would have been recommended
for the V.C. if he could have been found,
but he was supposed to have been killed).
I then wandered on, and had to cross a
shallow stream under fire of the guns of the
extensive Palace of the Kaiser Bagh, where
the enemy were said to have 20,000 men.
I was then hailed by an European sentry at
the gate of a very high wall, which I had
the unpleasant feeling was the Kaiser Bagh,
and that I was on the wrong road, but to
my great relief he told me it led to the
Residency, and that I must keep well under
the wall on the way to it, to avoid the
firing that was going on. On arriving at
the Residency I delivered my message to
General Havelock, who congratulated me
on my escape, as I was reported killed.</p>

<p>Of course I lost a great many of my
wounded, and one could see their skeletons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">412</a></span>lying outside the Palace, which we
afterwards took, during the two
months we were besieged in Lucknow.
I did not see my horse (that is painted
in my V.C. picture from a photograph)
till after I arrived in Lucknow,
where he was captured. He was badly
wounded by a large slug or bolt about two
inches long (which I have now) entering
deeply on the side of the chest, and which
was afterwards found most difficult to
extract with bullet forceps. Yet the horse
lived to aid Outram's relief outside Lucknow,
and afterwards was sold as a very
valuable charger for &#163;160.</p>

<p>The following account, written by himself,
of the military career of William Goate,
and of the heroic act of devotion for which
he was rewarded with the V.C., speaks for
itself and needs no introduction:&mdash;</p>

<p>My father died when I was only five
years old, and left mother with a family of
eleven of us, so as I grew up I had to work
in the fields till I was big enough to mind
horses. Then after a bit I got tired of the
country, although it was a pretty village in
Norfolk, called Tritton, close to Norwich;
so I thought I would go to Norwich and
get a job as a groom, which I did, and
stopped till I was 18. Then I thought I
would like another change, so up to London
I went, and I had a wish to be a soldier. I
was a smart lad and fresh-looking, so I went
to Westminster in November, 1853, and
enlisted in the 9th Lancers, and being a
groom I was quite at home in a cavalry
regiment; and I confess to being proud of
our gay uniform and fluttering pennons.
Well, after serving four years I was destined
to ride in many a wild charge and see men
and horses go down like ninepins, but I
never thought of danger. When we got
the order to charge, away we went determined
to win, and I can tell you it must
always be a terrible sight for any troops, let
alone Sepoys, to see a regiment of cavalry
sweeping down upon them.</p>

<p>Our fighting began at Delhi. We were
at Umballa when the Mutiny broke out,
and we were ordered to join in the operations
against Delhi. I was present at the
siege and capture of that city. I will tell
you of a little adventure of my own at this
time. Before the city was taken I was on
despatch duty at an advanced post with
orders to fetch reinforcements when the
enemy came out. One day I saw six men
trying to steal round by the river into our
camp. Believing them to be spies, I asked
the officer in charge of the picket to allow
me and two men to go and ascertain what
their intentions were. He gave us leave.
We had a very difficult job to get down to
the riverside on account of the rocks, and
when we got up to the men they showed
fight. We shot three of them with our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">413</a></span>
pistols&mdash;one each. Being on horseback we
then attacked them with the lance. One
daring fellow struck at me, and I couldn't
get at him. He slightly wounded my
horse and then made a run for the river.
I jumped from my horse, and, going into
the water after him, ran him through with
my lance. Meanwhile, the other two of
my companions had settled the two remaining
men. All this while a heavy fire had
played on us from the enemy's battery.
We had now to ride for our lives. On
getting back to the camp, the officer in
command sent me to the camp with a note
to the Colonel of the regiment, who made
me a lance-corporal then and there.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/scan413.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">"I RAN HIM THROUGH WITH MY LANCE."</p></div>
</div>

<p>I might say I was two years in the saddle,
almost continuously fighting. I was with
Sir Colin when he retook Cawnpore from
the Gwalior rebels. We went to the aid of
General Wyndham, who had been repulsed.
We crossed the bridge of boats under a heavy
fire, but forced our way in. As soon as
our brave leader got his men in position,
he carried everything before him. We could
still see traces of Nana Sahib's atrocity in
June, and every soldier vowed vengeance.
The affair that I was in when I gained my
Victoria Cross was before Lucknow, the
second time. Early in 1858 the rebels had
strongly fortified the place, and it became
necessary for Sir Colin to take it. Our
regiment had some hot work. It was on
March 6 that I won the Cross, in action at
Lucknow, having dismounted in the
presence of the enemy and taken up the
body of Major Percy Smith, 2nd Dragoon
Guards, which I attempted to bring off
the field, and after being obliged to relinquish
it, being surrounded by the enemy's
cavalry, going a second time, under a heavy
fire, to recover the body, for which I
received the Victoria Cross.</p>

<p>I will try and describe the fight, and
what I saw of it. The enemy appeared in
great force on the race-course outside
Lucknow, and the 9th Lancers, the 2nd
Dragoon Guards, and two native cavalry
regiments were ordered to charge. The
brigade swept on in grand style, and
clashed into the
enemy. We had
a fierce hand-to-hand
fight; but
our troops behaved
splendidly,
and at last we
broke them up.
Then we were
obliged to retire
under a heavy
fire. As we did
so Major Smith,
of the Dragoons,
was shot through
the body, and
fell from his
horse. Failing to
catch him, I
sprang to the
ground, and,
throwing the
bridle-rein over
my arm, raised
the Major on to
my shoulder; in this manner I ran alongside
of my horse for some hundreds of yards,
until I saw the enemy's cavalry close upon
me. Clearly I couldn't get away with my
burden, so I determined to do what I could
for myself.</p>

<p>Springing into my saddle, I shot the first
Sepoy who charged, and with my empty
pistol felled another. This gave me time
to draw my sword, my lance having been
left on the field. The Sepoys were now
round me cutting and hacking, but I
managed to parry every slash and deliver
many a fatal thrust. It was parry and
thrust, thrust and parry all through, and I
cannot tell you how many saddles I must
have emptied. The enemy didn't seem to
know how to parry.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">414</a></span></p>
<p>Taking advantage of this, I settled
accounts with a jolly lot. I was determined
not to be taken alive. At last some of the
Lancers saw me and came to my rescue.
Thinking the major might still be alive, I
went again to rescue him, but it was not
until the enemy's forces were driven back
that we got his body.</p>

<p>After the action, General Sir Colin Campbell,
General Sir Hope Grant, and some of
the cavalry officers shook hands with me
and complimented me.</p>

<p>In regard to the sword and lance, I
certainly prefer the lance; the lance is so
keen, it goes through a man before he
knows it. I was always very careful never
to let a swordsman get under my lance, and
in fighting with cavalry I made full use of
the pennon to baffle an enemy's horse.</p>

<p>The weapons of troops on active service
are made as keen as razors, and it was a
common thing during the Mutiny to see a
party of soldiers under the shade of a great
tree waiting their turn to get their blades
sharpened and the dints removed, ready
for the next fight with the rebels. Our
gallant little army was like a ship cleaving
its way through the sea, for wherever we
went, the enemy, like the waters, closed in
behind.</p>

<p class="a">HAT is never a nice moment
when your horse knocks up
under you, and you know
quite well that he has done
so, and that to ride him
another inch would be a
cruelty&mdash;another mile a sheer impossibility.
But when it happens in the Bush, the
moment is apt to become
more than negatively disagreeable;
for you may be
miles from the nearest habitation,
and an unpremeditated
bivouac, with neither
food nor blankets, is a thing
that demands a philosophic
temperament as well as the
quality of endurance. This
once befell the manager of
Dandong, in the back-blocks
of New South Wales,
just on the right side of the
Dandong boundary fence,
which is fourteen miles from
the homestead. Fortunately
Deverell, of Dandong,
was a young man, well used,
from his boyhood, to the
casual hardships of station
life, and well fitted by physique
to endure them. Also
he had the personal advantage
of possessing the philosophic
temperament large-sized.
He dismounted the
moment he knew for certain
what was the matter. A
ridge of pines&mdash;a sandy
ridge, where camping properly
equipped would have been perfect
luxury&mdash;rose against the stars a few
hundred yards ahead. But Deverell took off
the saddle on the spot, and carried it himself
as far as that ridge, where he took off
the bridle also, hobbled the done-up beast
with a stirrup-leather, and turned him adrift.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/scan422-2.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">"DEVERELL TOOK OFF THE SADDLE."</p></div>
</div>

<p>Deverell, of Dandong, was a good master
to his horses and his dogs, and not a bad
one to his men. Always the master first,
and the man afterwards, he was a little
selfish, as becomes your masterful man.
On the other hand, he was a singularly
frank young fellow. He would freely own,
for instance, that he was the luckiest man
in the back-blocks. This, to be sure, was
no more than the truth. But Deverell
never lost sight of his luck, nor was he ever
ashamed to recognise it: wherein he
differed from the average lucky man, who
says that luck had nothing to do with it.
Deverell could gloat over his luck, and do
nothing else&mdash;when he had nothing else to
do. And in this
way he faced
contentedly even
this lonely, hungry
night, his back to
a pine at the
north side of the
ridge, and a short brier pipe in full blast.</p>

<p>He was the new manager of Dandong, to
begin with. That was one of the best
managerships in the colony, and Deverell
had got it young&mdash;in his twenties, at all
events, if not by much. The salary was
seven hundred a year, and the homestead
was charming. Furthermore, Deverell
was within a month of his marriage; and
the coming Mrs. Deverell was a girl of some
social distinction down in Melbourne, and
a belle into the bargain, to say nothing of
another feature, which was entirely satisfactory,
without being so ample as to imperil
a man's independence. The homestead
would be charming indeed in a few weeks,
in time for Christmas. Meanwhile, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">423</a></span>
"clip" had been a capital one, and the
rains abundant; the paddocks were in a
prosperous state, the tanks overflowing,
everything going smoothly in its right
groove (as things do not always go on a big
station), and the proprietors perfectly
delighted with their new manager. Well,
the new manager was sufficiently delighted
with himself. He was lucky in his work
and lucky in his love&mdash;and what can the
gods do more for you? Considering that
he had rather worse than no antecedents
at all&mdash;antecedents
with so
dark a stain
upon them that,
anywhere but
in a colony, the
man would have
been a ruined
man from his
infancy&mdash;he was
really incredibly
lucky in his
love affair. But
whatever his
parents had
been or had
done, he had
now no relatives
at all of his
own: and this
is a great thing
when you are
about to make
new ones in an
inner circle: so
that here, once
more, Deverell
was in his usual
luck.</p>

<p>It does one
good to see a
man thoroughly
appreciating his
good luck. The
thing is so seldom
done.
Deverell not
only did this,
but did it with
complete sincerity.
Even
to-night, though personally most uncomfortable,
and tightening his belt after
every pipe, he could gaze at the stars with
grateful eyes, obscure them with clouds of
smoke, watch the clouds disperse and the
stars shine bright again, and call himself
again and again, and yet again, the
luckiest man in the Colony.</p>

<p>While Deverell sat thus, returning thanks
on an empty stomach, at the northern edge
of the ridge, a man tramped into the pines
from the south. The heavy sand muffled
his steps; but he stopped long before he
came near Deverell, and threw down his
swag with an emancipated air. The man
was old, but he held himself more erect
than does the typical swagman. The
march through life with a cylinder of
blankets on one's shoulders,
with all one's worldly goods
packed in that cylinder,
causes a certain stoop of a
very palpable kind; and this
the old man, apparently, had
never contracted. Other
points slightly distinguished
him from the
ordinary run of
swagmen. His
garments were
orthodox, but
the felt wide-awake
was stiff
and new, and
so were the
moleskins;
these, indeed,
might have
stood upright
without any
legs in them at
all. The old
man's cheeks,
chin, and
upper lip were
covered with
short grey
bristles, like
spikes of steel;
above the
bristles he had
that "lean and
hungry look"
which Cæsar
saw in Cassius.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">"A MAN TRAMPED INTO THE PINES."</p></div>
</div>

<p>He rested a
little on his
swag. "So this
is Dandong,"
he muttered, as if speaking to the Dandong
sand between his feet. "Well, now
that I am within his boundary-fence at
last, I am content to rest. Here I camp.
To-morrow I shall see him!"</p>

<p>Deverell, at the other side of the ridge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">424</a></span>
dimming the stars with his smoke, for the
pleasure of seeing them shine bright again,
heard a sound which was sudden music to
his ears. The sound was a crackle. Deverell
stopped smoking, but did not move; it was
difficult to believe his ears. But the crackle
grew louder; Deverell jumped up and saw
the swagman's fire within a hundred yards
of him; and the difficult thing to believe
in <i>then</i> was his own unparalleled good luck.</p>

<p>"There is no
end to it," he
chuckled, taking
his saddle over
one arm and
snatching up the
water-bag and
bridle. "Here's
a swaggie stopped
to camp, with
flour for a
damper, and a
handful of tea
for the quart-pot,
as safe as the
bank! Perhaps
a bit of blanket
for me too! But
I <i>am</i> the luckiest
man in the
Colony; this
wouldn't have
happened to anyone
else!"</p>

<p>He went over
to the fire, and the
swagman, who
was crouching at
the other side
of it, peered at him from under a floury side
palm. He was making the damper already.
His welcome to Deverell took a substantial
shape; he doubled the flour for the damper.
Otherwise the old tramp did not gush.</p>

<p>Deverell did the talking. Lying at full
length on the blankets, which had been
unrolled, his face to the flames, and his
strong jaws cupped in his hands, he discoursed
very freely of his luck.</p>

<p>"You're saving my life," said he, gaily.
"I should have starved. I didn't think it
at the time, but now I know I should. I
thought I could hold out, between belt and
'baccy, but I couldn't now, anyhow. If I
hold out till the damper's baked, it's all I
can do now. It's like my luck! I never
saw anything look quite so good before.
There now, bake up. Got any tea?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Meat?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Well, we could have done with meat,
but it can't be helped. I'm lucky enough
to get anything. It's my luck all over.
I'm the luckiest man in the Colony, let me
tell you. But we could have done with
chops. Gad, but I'd have some yet, if I
saw a sheep! They're all wethers in this
paddock, but they don't draw down towards
the gate much."</p>

<p>He turned his
head, and knitted
his brows, but it
was difficult to distinguish
things
beyond the immediate
circle of firelit
sand, and he saw no
sheep. To do the
man justice, he
would not have
touched one if he
had; he had said
what he did not
mean; but
something in
his way of saying
it made the old man stare at him hard.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/scan424.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">"HE HAD TURNED HIS BACK."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"Then you're one of the gentlemen
from Dandong Station, are you, sir?"</p>

<p>"I am," said Deverell. "My horse is fresh
off the grass, and a bit green. He's knocked
up, but he'll be all right in the morning;
the crab-holes are full of water, and there's
plenty of feed about. Indeed it's the best
season we've had for years&mdash;my luck again,
you see!"</p>

<p>The tramp did not seem to hear all he
said. He had turned his back, and was
kneeling over the fire, deeply engrossed,
with the water-bag and the quart-pot&mdash;which
he was filling. It was with much
apparent preoccupation that he asked:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Deverell, the boss, there now?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">425</a></span></p>

<p>"He is." Deverell spoke drily, and
thought a minute. After all, there was no
object in talking about himself in the third
person to a man who would come applying
to him for work the next day. Realising
this, he added, with a touch of dignity, "I'm
he."</p>

<p>The tramp's arm jerked, a small fountain
played out of the bottle neck of the water-bag
and fell with a hiss upon the fire. The
tramp still knelt with his back to Deverell.
The blood had left his face, his eyes were
raised to the pale, bright stars, his lips
moved. By a great effort he knelt as he
had been kneeling before Deverell spoke;
until Deverell spoke again.</p>

<p>"You were on your way to see me, eh?"</p>

<p>"I was on my way to Dandong."</p>

<p>"Wanting work? Well, you shall have
it," said Deverell, with decision. "I don't
want hands, but I'll take <i>you</i> on; you've
saved my life, my good fellow, or you're
going to, in a brace of shakes. How goes
the damper?"</p>

<p>"Well," said the old man, answering
Deverell's last question shortly, but ignoring
his first altogether. "Shall I sweeten
the tea or not?"</p>

<p>"Sweeten it."</p>

<p>The old man got ready a handful of tea
and another of sugar to throw into the
quart-pot the moment the water boiled.
He had not yet turned round. Still kneeling,
with the soles of his boots under
Deverell's nose, he moved the damper from
time to time, and made the tea. His hands
shook.</p>

<p>Deverell made himself remarkably happy
during the next half-hour. He ate the hot
damper, he drank the strong tea, in a way
that indicated unbounded confidence in his
digestive powers. A dyspeptic must have
wept for envy. Towards the end of the
meal he discovered that the swagman&mdash;who
sat remote from the fire, and seemed to be
regarding Deverell with a gaze of peculiar
fascination&mdash;had scarcely broken his bread.</p>

<p>"Aren't you hungry?" asked Deverell,
with his mouth full.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>But Deverell <i>was</i>, and that, after all, was
the main thing. If the old man had no
appetite, there was no earthly reason for
him to eat; his abstinence could not hurt
him under the circumstances, and naturally
it did not worry Deverell. If, on the other
hand, the old man preferred to feed off
Deverell&mdash;with his eyes&mdash;why, there is no
accounting for preferences, and that did not
worry Deverell either. Indeed, by the
time his pipe was once more in blast, he
felt most kindly disposed towards this
taciturn tramp. He would give him a
billet. He would take him on as a rabbiter,
and rig him out with a tent, camp fixings,
traps, and even&mdash;perhaps&mdash;a dog or two.
He would thus repay in princely fashion
to-night's good turn&mdash;but now, confound
the thing! He had been sitting the whole
evening on the old fool's blankets, and the
old fool had been sitting on the ground!</p>

<p>"I say! Why on earth don't you come
and sit on your own blankets?" asked
Deverell, a little roughly; for to catch
oneself in a grossly thoughtless act is always
irritating.</p>

<p>"I am all right here, thank you," returned
the swagman, mildly. "The sand
is as soft as the blankets."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't want to monopolise your
blankets, you know," said Deverell, without
moving. "Take a fill from my pouch, will
you?"</p>

<p>He tossed over his pouch of tobacco.
The swagman handed it back&mdash;he did not
smoke; had got out of the way of it, he
said. Deverell was disappointed. He had
a genuine desire at all times to repay in
kind anything resembling a good turn.
He could not help being a little selfish; it
was constitutional.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what," said Deverell, leaning
backward on one elbow, and again clouding
the stars with wreaths of blue smoke, "I've
got a little berth that ought to suit you
down to the ground. It's rabbiting. Done
any rabbiting before? No. Well, it's easy
enough; what's more, you're your own
boss. Catch as many as you can or care to,
bring in the skins, and get sixpence each
for 'em. Now the berth I mean is a box-clump,
close to a tank, where there's been
a camp before, and the last man did very
well there; still, you'll find he has left
plenty of rabbits behind him. It's the very
spot for you; and, look here, I'll start you
with rations, tent, camp-oven, traps, and all
the rest of it!" wound up Deverell,
generously. He had spoken out of the
fulness of his soul and body. He had
seldom spoken so decently to a pound-a-week
hand&mdash;never to a swagman.</p>

<p>Yet the swagman did not jump at the
offer.</p>

<p>"Mr. Deverell," said he, rolling the name
on his tongue in a curious way, "I was not
coming exactly for work. I was coming to
see you. I knew your father!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">426</a></span></p>

<p>"The deuce you did!" said Deverell.</p>

<p>The old man was watching him keenly.
In an instant Deverell had flushed up from
his collar to his wideawake. He was manifestly
uncomfortable. "Where did you know
him?" he asked doggedly.</p>

<p>The tramp bared his head; the short grey
hair stood crisply on end all over it. He
tapped his head significantly, and ran the
palm of his hand over the strong bristles
of his beard.</p>

<p>"So," said Deverell, drawing his breath
hard. "Now I see; you are a brother
convict!"</p>

<p>The tramp nodded.</p>

<p>"And you know all about him&mdash;the
whole story?"</p>

<p>The tramp nodded again.</p>

<p>"By God!" cried Deverell, "if you've
come here to trade on what you know,
you've chosen the wrong place and the
wrong man."</p>

<p>The tramp smiled. "I have not come to
trade upon what I know," said he quietly,
repeating the other's expression with simple
sarcasm. "Now that I've seen you, I can
go back the way I came; no need to go on
to Dandong now. I came because my old
mate asked me to find you out and wish
you well from him: that was all."</p>

<p>"He went in
for life," said
Deverell, reflecting
bitterly. "I
have the vaguest
memories of him; it happened when I was
so very young. Is he well?"</p>

<p>"He was."</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/scan426.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">"IT WAS ALL WRONG TOGETHER."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"And you have been in gaol together!
And you know what brought him there,
the whole story!" Curiosity crept into the
young man's tone, and made it less bitter.
He filled a pipe. "For my part, I never
had the rights of that story," he said.</p>

<p>"There were no rights," said the convict.
"It was all wrong together. Your father
robbed the bank of which he himself was
manager. He had lost money in mining
speculations. He took to the bush, and
fought desperately for his life."</p>

<p>"I'm glad he did that!" exclaimed
Deverell.</p>

<p>The other's eyes kindled, but he only
said: "It was what anyone would have
done in his place."</p>

<p>"Is it?" answered Deverell scornfully.
"Did <i>you</i>, for instance?"</p>

<p>The old man shrugged his shoulders.
Deverell laughed aloud. His father might
have been a villain, but he had not been a
coward. That was one consolation.</p>

<p>A silence fell between the two men.
There were no more flames from the fire,
but only the glow of red-hot embers. This
reddened the face of Deverell, but it did
not reach that of the old man. He was
thus free to stare at Deverell as hard and
as long as he liked, and his eyes never left
the young man's face. It was a sufficiently
handsome face, with eyes as dark as those
of the old man, only lightened and brightened
by an expression altogether different.
Deverell's pipe had soothed him. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">427</a></span>
seemed as serene now as he had been before
he knew that his companion had been
also the companion of his father&mdash;in prison.
After all, he had grown up with the knowledge
that his father was a convicted felon;
to be reminded of it casually, but also privately,
could not wound him <i>very</i> deeply.
The tramp, staring at him with a fierce
yearning in his eyes, which the young man
could not see, seemed to divine this, but
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It cannot be pleasant for you to see me.
I wouldn't have come, only I promised to
see you; I promised to let him hear about
you. It would have been worse, you know,
had he got out on ticket-of-leave, and come
himself!"</p>

<p>"It would so!" exclaimed Deverell sincerely.</p>

<p>In the dark, the old man grinned like
one in torment.</p>

<p>"It would so," Deverell repeated, unable
to repress a grim chuckle. "It would be
the most awkward thing that could possibly
happen to me&mdash;especially if it happened
now. At present I call myself the luckiest
man in the Colony; but if my poor father
were to turn up&mdash;"</p>

<p>Deverell was not interrupted; he stopped
himself.</p>

<p>"You are pretty safe," said his companion
in an odd tone&mdash;which he quickly changed.
"As your father's mate, I am glad you are
so lucky; it is good hearing."</p>

<p>Deverell explained how he was so lucky.
He felt that the sentiments he had expressed
concerning his father's possible
appearance on the scene required some explanation,
if not excuse. This feeling,
growing upon him as he spoke, led him
into explanations that were very full indeed,
under the circumstances. He explained
the position he had attained as manager of
Dandong; and the position he was about
to attain through his marriage was quite as
clearly&mdash;though unintentionally&mdash;indicated.
It was made clear to the meanest perception
how very awkward it would be for the
young man, from every point of view, if the
young man's father <i>did</i> turn up and ostentatiously
reveal himself. While Deverell
was speaking the swagman broke branches
from the nearest pines and made up the
fire; when he finished the faces of both
were once more illumined; and that of the
old man was stern with resolve.</p>

<p>"And yet," said he, "suppose the impossible,
or at any rate the unlikely&mdash;say
that he does come back. I know him well;
he wouldn't be a drag or a burden to you.
He'd only just like to see you. All he
would ask would be to see his son sometimes!
That would be enough for him.
I was his chum, mind you, so I know. And
if he was to come up here, as I have come,
you could take him on, couldn't you, as
you offer to take me?" He lent forward
with sudden eagerness&mdash;his voice vibrated.
"You could give him work, as you say
you'll give me, couldn't you? No one'd
know it was your father! No one would
ever guess!"</p>

<p>"No!" said Deverell, decidedly. "I'll
give <i>you</i> work, but my father I couldn't.
I don't do things by halves: I'd treat my
father <i>as</i> my father, and damn the odds!
He had pluck. I like to think how he was
taken fighting! Whatever he did, he had
grit, and I should be unworthy of him&mdash;no
matter what he did&mdash;if I played the
coward. It would be worse than cowardly
to disown your father, whatever he had
done, and I wouldn't disown mine&mdash;I'd
sooner shoot myself! No, I'd take him in,
and be a son to him for the rest of his days,
that's what I'd do&mdash;that's what I <i>will</i> do, if
ever he gets out on ticket-of-leave, and
comes to me!"</p>

<p>The young man spoke with a feeling and
intensity of which he had exhibited no
signs before, leaning forward with his pipe
between his fingers. The old man held his
breath.</p>

<p>"But it would be devilish awkward!"
he added frankly. "People would remember
what they've been good enough to forget;
and everybody would know what now
next to none know. In this country, thank
God, the man is taken for what the man is
worth&mdash;his father neither helps nor hinders
him, when once he's gone. So I've managed
to take my own part, and to get on
well, thanks to my own luck. Yes, it
would be devilish awkward, but I'd stand
by him, before Heaven, I would!"</p>

<p>The old man breathed hard.</p>

<p>"I don't know how I've come to say so
much to you, though you did know my
father," added Deverell, with a sudden
change of tone. "It isn't my way at all. I
needn't tell you that from to-morrow forward
you're the same as any other man to
me. And if you ever go to see my father,
you must not tell him all I have said to you
about what, as you say, is never likely to
happen. But you may tell him&mdash;you may
tell him I am glad he was taken fighting!"</p>

<p>The old man was once more quite calm.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">428</a></span>
"I shall never see your father again. No
more will you," he said slowly and solemnly;
"for your father is dead! I promised him to
find you out when my time was up, and to
tell you. I have taken my own way of
breaking the news to you. Forgive me, sir;
but I couldn't resist just seeing, first of all,
if it would cut you up very badly!"</p>

<p>Deverell did not notice the quiet bitterness
of the last words. He smoked his pipe
out in silence. Then he said: "God rest
him! Perhaps it's for the best. As for
you, you've a billet at Dandong for the rest
of your days, if you like to take and keep
it. Let us turn in."</p>

<p>The worn moon rose very late, and
skimmed behind the pines, but never rose
clear of them, and was down
before dawn. It shone faintly
upon the two men lying side
by side, packed up each in a
blanket&mdash;Deverell in the better
one. From the other blanket
a hand would steal out from
time to time, grope tremulously
over Deverell's back,
lie a minute, and then be
gently withdrawn. Long before
dawn, however, the old
man noiselessly arose and
rolled up his swag. He packed
up every thing
that he had
brought&mdash;every thing
except the better blanket. Over that
he smiled, as though it was an intense
pleasure to him to leave it behind, lapped
round the unconscious form of Deverell.
Just before going, when the swag was on his
back, he stooped down once and put his face
very close to that of Deverell. The worn
moon glimmered through the pines upon
them both. The faces were strangely alike;
only Deverell's was smiling sweetly in his
dreams, while the other's shone moist with&mdash;something.</p>

<p>A few minutes later the gate in the
Dandong boundary-fence closed for the last
time upon the gaol-bird tramp; and
Deverell's father was dead indeed&mdash;to
Deverell. Lucky for Deverell, of course.
But then he was the luckiest man in the whole
Colony. Didn't he say so himself?</p>

<p>The shop we are
about to visit&mdash;perhaps
quite the
most remarkable
in London&mdash;stands
in a remarkable
street,
Ratcliff-highway.
Ratcliff-highway
is not what it was&mdash;indeed,
its proper
name is now
St. George's-street,
but it still retains
much of its old
eccentric character.
The
casual pedestrian
who wanders
from the
neighbourhood
of the Mint, past
the end of
Leman-street
and the entrance to the London Dock, need
no longer fear robbery with violence; nor may
he with any confidence look to witness a
skirmish of crimps and foreign sailors with
long knives; but, if his taste for observation
incline to more tranquil harvest, his eye, quiet
or restless, will fall upon many a reminder
of the Highway's historic days, and of those
relics of its ancient character which still
linger. Sailors' boarding-houses are seen
in great numbers, often with crossed flags,
or a ship in full sail, painted, in a conventional
spirit peculiar to the district, upon
the windows. Here and there is a slop shop
where many dangling oilskins and sou'westers
wave in the breeze, and where, as
often as not, an old figure-head or the
effigy of a naval officer in the uniform of
fifty years ago stands as a sign. There are
shops where advance notes are changed, and
where the windows present a curious medley
of foreign bank notes, clay pipes, china
tobacco-jars, and sixpenny walking sticks,
and there are many swarthy-faced men, with
ringed ears, with print shirts and trousers
unsupported by braces; also there are many
ladies with gigantic feathers in their
bonnets, of painful hue, and other ladies
who get along very comfortably without
any bonnets at all.</p>

<p>In a street like this, every shop is, more
or less, an extraordinary one; but no
stranger would expect to find in one of
them the largest and most varied collection
of arms, curiosities, and works of savage
and civilised art brought together for trade
purposes in the world, and this side by side
with a stock of lions, tigers, panthers,
elephants, alligators, monkeys, or parrots.
Such a shop, however, will be the most
interesting object of contemplation to the
stray wayfarer through St. George's-street,
and this is the shop famed throughout the
world as Jamrach's. Everybody, of course,
knows Jamrach's by name, and perhaps
most know it to be situated somewhere in
the waterside neighbourhood of the East-end;
but few consider it anything more than
an emporium from which the travelling
menageries are supplied with stock. This,
of course, it is, but it is something besides;
and, altogether, one of the most curious
and instructive spots which the seeker after
the quaint and out-of-the-way may visit is
Jamrach's.</p>

<p>The shop, which we find on the left-hand
side as we approach it from the west, is a
double one, and might easily be taken for
two separate establishments. The first
window we reach might be passed as that
of an ordinary bird fancier's, were the
attention not attracted by the unusually
neat, clean, and roomy appearance of the
cages displayed, and the uncommon shapes
and colours of the birds which inhabit
them. The next window is more catching
to the eye. Furious Japanese figures,
squatting Hindoo gods, strange and beautiful
marine shells, and curious pottery bring
the pedestrian to a stand, and arouse a
desire to explore within. All this outside,
however, gives small promise of the strange
things to be seen and learnt behind the
scenes. Returning to the door by the
aviary window, we enter, and find ourselves
in a bright, clean room, eighteen or twenty
feet square, properly warmed by a stove
placed in the centre. The walls, from floor
to ceiling, are fitted with strong and commodious
wire cages, in which birds of
wonderful voice and hue and monkeys of
grotesque lineament yell, whistle, shriek,
and chatter. Great and gorgeous parrots
of rare species flutter and scream, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">430</a></span>
blinking owls screw their heads aside as we
pass. But the cause in chief of all this
commotion is the presence of an attendant
in shirt-sleeves, who, carrying with him a
basket, is distributing therefrom certain
eatables much coveted hereabout. Beaked
heads are thrust between
bars, and many a long,
brown arm reaches down-ward
and forward from the
monkey-cages, in perilous
proximity to the eager
beaks. In a special cage,
standing out from the rest,
a beautiful black and white
lemur sits and stretches his
neck to be fondled as the
attendant passes, but shyly
hides his face when we
strangers approach him.</p>

<p>Here Mr. Jamrach himself
comes to meet us&mdash;a
fine old gentleman, whose
many years and remarkable
experiences have left but
small impression upon him.
Coming from Hamburg&mdash;where
his father before
him was a trading naturalist&mdash;he
founded the present
business in Shadwell more
than fifty years ago, and
here he is still in his daily
harness, with all the appearance
of being quite fit for
another half-century of
work among snakes and
tigers. His two sons&mdash;one
of whom we shall presently
meet&mdash;have assisted him in
the business all their lives.
The elder of these, who was
a widely-known naturalist
of great personal popularity,
died some few years since. Mr.
Jamrach takes us into a small, dusty back
room, quaint in its shape and quaint in its
contents. Arms of every kind which is not
an ordinary kind stand in corners, hang on
walls, and litter the floors; great two-handed
swords of mediæval date and of
uncompromisingly English aspect stand
amid heaps of Maori clubs, African spears,
and Malay kreeses; on the floor lies, open,
a deal box filled with rough sheets of tortoise-shell,
and upon the walls hang several
pictures and bas-reliefs. Mr. Jamrach picks
up by a string a dusty piece of metal, flat,
three-quarters of an inch thick, and of an
odd shape, rather resembling a cheese-cutter.
This, we are informed is a bell, or,
perhaps more accurately, a gong, and was
used on the tower of a Burmese temple to
summon the worshippers. Reaching for a
short knobkerry, which bears more than
one sign of having made things lively on
an antipodean skull, Mr. Jamrach strikes
the uninviting piece of metal upon the side
in such a way as to cause it to spin, and
we, for the first time, fully realise what
sweet music may lie in a bell. The sound
is of the most startling volume&mdash;as loud as
that of a good-sized church bell, in fact&mdash;and
dies away very slowly and gradually
in a prolonged note of indescribable sweetness.
The metal is a peculiar amalgam,
silver being the chief ingredient; and oh
that all English church bells&mdash;and, for that
matter, dinner bells&mdash;had the beautiful
voice of this quaint bit of metal!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">431</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/scan431.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">A QUEER GONG.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Then Mr. Jamrach shows us wonderful
and gorgeous marine shells, of extreme
value and rarity, and some of a species
which he originally introduced to men of
science, in consequence of which it now
bears an appalling Latin name ending with
<i>jamrachus</i>.</p>

<p>Passing from the back of this little room,
we enter a very large one, extending from
the front to the back of the entire premises,
with a gallery on three sides above. Here
we are joined by the younger Mr. Jamrach,
and here we stand amid the most bewildering
multitude of bric-a-brac and quaint
valuables ever jumbled together: fantastic
gods and goddesses, strange arms and
armour, wonderful carvings in ivory, and
priceless gems of old Japanese pottery.
Merely to enumerate in the baldest way a
tenth part of these things would fill this
paper, and briefly to describe a hundredth
part would fill the magazine. And when
we express our wonder at the extent of the
collection, we are calmly informed that this
is only a part&mdash;there are more about the
building&mdash;four or five roomfuls or so!</p>

<p>We have come to St. George's-street expecting
to see nothing but a
zoological warehouse, and all
this is a surprise. That such
a store as we now see were
hidden away in Shadwell
would have seemed highly
improbable, and indeed we are
told that very few people are
aware of its existence. "The
museums know us, however,"
says Mr. Jamrach the younger,
"and many of their chief
treasures have come from this
place." Among the few
curious visitors who have
found their way to Jamrach's
there has been the Prince of
Wales, who stayed long, and
left much surprised and
pleased at all he had seen. The
late Frank Buckland, too,
whose whole-souled passion
for natural history took him
to this establishment day after
day, often for all day, could
rarely resist the fascination of
the museum, even while his
beloved animals growled in
the adjacent lairs. The
Jamrachs do not push the
sale of this bric-a-brac, and
seem to love to keep the
strange things about them. Their trade
is in animals, and their dealings in
arms and curiosities form almost a hobby.
Many of the beautiful pieces of pottery have
stood here thirty years, and their proud
possessors seem in no great anxiety to part
with them now. A natural love of the quaint
and beautiful first led Mr. Jamrach to buy
carvings and shells from the seafaring men
who brought him his birds and monkeys,
so that these men soon were led to regard
his warehouse as the regulation place of
disposal for any new or old thing from across
the seas; and so sprang up this overflowing
museum.</p>

<p>Among hundreds of idols we are shown
three which are especially noteworthy. The
first is a splendid life-sized Buddha&mdash;a work
of surprising grace and art. The god is represented
as sitting, his back being screened
by a great shell of the purest design. The
whole thing is heavily gilt, and is set, in
places, with jewels. Every line is a line of
grace, and the features, while of a distinct
Hindoo cast, beam with a most refined mildness.
What monetary value Mr. Jamrach
sets on this we do not dare to ask; and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">432</a></span>
indeed, we are now placed before the second
of the three&mdash;a Vishnu carved in alto-relievo
of some hard black wood. This is a piece
of early Indian art, and it has a history. It
was fished up some twenty years ago from
the bottom of the river
Krishna, where it had been
reverently deposited by its
priests to save it from insult
and mutilation at the
hands of the invading
Mohammedan; and there
it had lain for eight
hundred years. It is undamaged,
with the exception
that the two more
prominent of the four arms
are broken off; and that it
has escaped the insult
which its devout priests
feared is testified by the
fact that the nose&mdash;straight,
delicate, and almost European
in shape&mdash;has not
been broken. It is an extremely
rare thing for a
Vishnu free from this
desecration&mdash;a fatal one in
the eyes of worshippers&mdash;to
be seen in this country.
Above the head are carved
medallions representing the
ten incarnations of the
god, for the last of which
mighty avatars millions
still devoutly wait in mystic
India; while here, in
Ratcliff-highway, after all
its dark adventures, and
after its eight centuries of
immersion below the
Krishna, stands the embodiment
of the god himself,
mildly serene and meekly
dignified.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/scan432.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">A FRIENDLY DEITY.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The third of these gods is quite a different
person. There is nothing resembling
beauty&mdash;either of conception or workmanship&mdash;about
him. He is very flat-chested,
and his form is faithfully represented in
the accompanying illustration; without an
illustration he would be indescribable. The
head is very small, and grotesquely carved,
with a large boar's tusk projecting from
the jaw. The trunk and limbs, however,
are the parts of interest; they consist of
an entire human skin stretched on a sort of
flat wooden framework, and partly stuffed
with dried grasses. The skin is a light
brown, leathery looking stuff, with here
and there a small crack. The legs are
clothed with loose blue trousers, which
appear to be of dungaree, or a similar
material, and the complete deity came
from the Friendly Islands
some time since. Just at
his feet lie, in an open
packing box, certain mummified
heads, some bearing
unmistakable marks of
hard knocks, all having
been, no doubt, among
the most cherished possessions
of the gentleman
who had separated them
from the shoulders upon
which they originally grew.</p>

<p>Of heads and skulls we
see many, and among
them the skull of an
undoubted cannibal&mdash;a
thing of very peculiar
conformation. And so we
go on from room to room,
where the sunlight peeps
in with difficulty, and
paints with light and
shadow the memorials of
savage art, warfare and
worship, as well as many
exquisite specimens
of porcelain
and metal
work from Japan
and Florence.
We see the garment
of cowtails
which Ketchwayo
wore when
taken prisoner, and we see
a testimony to the guile
of the wily Maori in an
axe made of iron only, but
painted and got up to exactly
resemble greenstone. The reason of the
disguise becomes apparent when it is
explained that for the genuine greenstone
article of this pattern a collector will
gladly pay a hundred pounds, while the
metal imitation is worth its weight as old
iron, and no more. We see two pairs of
magnificent china vases five or six feet high,
the like of which it would be difficult to
find offered for sale anywhere. Another
pair, which had stood here for thirty years,
were bought only a week or two back by a
visitor of title with a cheque of three
figures&mdash;a bargain which the buyer jumped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">433</a></span>
at. We are shown old Satsuma ware of
wondrous delicacy and richness, commanding
something more than its weight in
sovereigns in the market. We see grand
old <i>repouss&#233;</i> work in very high relief. We
linger over a singular old Japanese medicine
cabinet, the outside of which is covered
with hundreds of little silver charms,
against as many varieties of disease&mdash;each
charm a quaintly-wrought oval or scarabæus.
We examine two immense Japanese
vases of copper, each six feet high, and of
the most elaborate workmanship, the design
revealing here and there, in a surprising
manner, elementary forms and principles
usually supposed to be wholly and originally
Greek. There are stone weapons,
bronze weapons, steel weapons, and wooden
weapons of every outlandish sort, and
musical instruments such as one sees represented
on Egyptian sculptures. There
are many things bought at the sale of the
effects of the late king of Oude, an enthusiastic
old gentleman whose allowance from
the British Government was a lac of rupees
a month, and who managed to spend it all,
and more than all, on curiosities and works
of art, so that his funeral was followed by a
sale on behalf of his creditors. Among the
old king's treasures in this place are seven
small figures, of a dancing bear, a buck
antelope, a gladiator, a satyr riding a
furious bull, another riding a camel, an
armed man on a rhinoceros, and a monkey
mounted on a goat, respectively. Each of
these little figures is built up of innumerable
smaller figures of beasts, birds, and
fishes, fighting and preying upon each other,
not one speck of the whole surface belonging
to the main representation, while,
nevertheless, the whole produces the figure
complete with its every joint, muscle, sinew,
and feature. And so we pass, by innumerable
sacred masks, pashas' tails and alligators'
skulls, toward the other and main department
of this remarkable warehouse&mdash;that
devoted to natural history.</p>

<p>We cross Britten's-court, where we
observe a van with a small crowd of boys
collected about it. A crane is swung out
from a high floor, and from the end of the
dependent chain hangs a wooden case or
cage, violently agitated by the movements
of the active inhabitant. He is a black
panther, the most savage sort of beast with
which Mr. Jamrach has to deal, and, as this
one feels himself gradually rising through
the air, his surprise and alarm manifest
themselves in an outburst strongly reminding
the spectator of Mark Twain's blown-up
cat "a-snorting, and a-clawing, and
a-reaching for things like all possessed." He
arrives at his appointed floor at last, however,
and, as the cage is swung in, the
blazing eyes and gleaming teeth turn from
our side toward the attendant who receives
him.</p>

<p>The wide doors on the ground floor are
swung open, and we enter a large apartment
fitted with strong iron-barred cages on all
sides. This is the lowest of three floors,
similarly fitted, in which is carried on a
trade in living creatures which is known
from one end of the earth to the other.
Jamrach's is <i>the</i> market for wild animals
from all the world over, and whatever a
menagerie-keeper or a zoological collection
may want, from an elephant to an Angora
cat, can be had in response to an order sent
here. Whatever animal a man may have
to sell, here he may sell it, providing that
it be in good and healthy condition. Mr.
Jamrach has lived a lifetime among his
beasts, and has had his troubles and adventures
with them. One of the most exciting
of these adventures took place some thirty
years ago. A fine, full-grown Bengal tiger
was deposited, in his rough wooden cage, on
this very spot at the gates, having just been
delivered from a ship in the docks. The
lair at the back was being prepared for his
reception, when, the attention of Mr.
Jamrach and his merry men being otherwise
engaged, <i>Tigris regalis</i> set his hind
quarters against the back of his temporary
receptacle, and, using all his strength,
managed to burst out the boards. Then
he quietly trotted out, and down the main
street. The sudden appearance of a full-sized
tiger at mid-day on the pavement of
Ratcliff-highway was the signal for a
general skedaddle, excepting on the part of
a little boy of about eight years of age,
who, never having seen a thing of the sort
before, innocently extended his hand and
stroked the big cat. A playful tap of the
great soft paw at once knocked the child
upon his face, stunned; and, picking him
up by the loose part of the jacket, the animal
was proceeding up the next turning, when
Mr. Jamrach, who had just discovered the
escape, came running up. Empty-handed
as he was, he sprang at the tiger's neck
from behind, and, grasping the throat with
both hands, drove his thumbs into the soft
place behind the jaw. Mr. Jamrach was an
unusually powerful man&mdash;indeed, he is no
weakling now, though nearer eighty than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">434</a></span>
seventy years of age&mdash;and at his scientific
grasp the tiger, half choked, let his captive
fall, when a couple of heavy blows across
the eyes from a crowbar thrust into the
naturalist's hands by an attendant
thoroughly cowed the great beast, who
turned tail and meekly trotted back straight
into the lair prepared for him, the door of
which stood open for his reception. The
little boy was without a scratch; but,
although &#163;50 was offered his father as compensation,
Mr. Jamrach's intrepidity was
rewarded by an action for &#163;500 damages.
In the end the smaller amount first offered
was awarded, and the loss in costs was
made sweeter by the judge's praise of the
defendant's prompt and courageous action.
The monetary loss had already been discounted
by the arrival, in hot haste,
the day after the accident, of a showman,
who gladly paid &#163;300 for the culprit.
This was no bad speculation on his part,
it was found, when he had counted up
the sixpences received all over the
country for admission to see the "tiger
that had eaten a boy alive in Ratcliff-highway."</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/scan434.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">TACKLING THE TIGER.</p></div>
</div>

<p>And so, with many an anecdote of his
own and his father's experiences in their
peculiar business from Mr. Jamrach the
younger, we go upstairs and wander among
the stock. This, of course, is ever varying
in quantity and species, but has always
some interesting feature. We are introduced
to a solemn monkey, who salaams
gravely three times, and then waits to be
asked to shake hands, which he does with
great ceremony. We see porcupines, black
swans and antelopes, and we hear, at the
peril of never hearing anything afterwards,
the noisy cranes. There is a Sumatra civet
cat, with a small, fox-like head, and a
magnificent tail; he is not cordial, and
snaps an awkward-looking row of sharp
teeth at us. Just behind his little cage is
a large one, which contains a fine, tall
guanaco or wild llama. The docile-looking
creature moves to and fro behind the bars,
keeping his eye on us, and pursing his
mouth the while. Suddenly Mr. Jamrach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">435</a></span>
says, "Look out, he's going to spit!"
and we all duck in different directions
with great celerity&mdash;only just in time.
The intelligent quadruped has conceived
a prejudice against the shape of somebody's
hat, or the colour of somebody's
tie, and expresses it by spitting, with much
force and precision, at the offender's face.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/scan435.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">LUNCHEON.</p></div>
</div>

<p>A large increase in the general chatter and
growl around us announces the approach of
an attendant with food. The emus and
cassowaries stretch their long necks as far
between the bars as possible, and the pelicans
and cranes yell agonisingly. A large black
panther throws himself against the bars of
his cage, and gives voice unrestrainedly.
In contrast to these, the domestic cat of
the establishment follows the man's heels,
with much tender purring and a sharp eye
to any stray fallen morsel. There are other
cats here in cages&mdash;cats too valuable to be
allowed to run loose&mdash;magnificent Angoras
and Carthusians, who rub their heads
against the wires, and, as we approach,
extend their paws in an appeal to
be noticed and petted.</p>

<p>We are promised an interesting
feeding sight downstairs, and we
descend to the ground floor.
Among the more risky speculations
of the commercial naturalist
are the alligator and the crocodile.
They will sulk and go into a
decline on the least provocation
or without any provocation at all,
and, being expensive to begin
with, often prove awkward losses.
They almost invariably sulk at
first, we are told, and, refusing to
take food, would be likely to get
into a bad way unless cured; and
the curing of a crocodile's sulks is
a surprising thing to see. We
find, on reaching the ground floor,
poor crocodilus laid by the heels
and perfectly helpless, lashed immovably
to iron rings and posts.
His head is ignominiously sat
upon by a sturdy man in shirt-sleeves,
who presently pokes the
end of a crowbar among the big
teeth, and forcibly prizes the
mouth open into that position of
comprehensive smile so familiar
to the readers of children's natural
history books. Then another man
kneels before the unfortunate
reptile and feeds him. That is
to say, he takes a lump of meat
weighing five or ten pounds or so, and
dexterously pitches it into the &oelig;sophagus,
afterwards firmly and decisively ramming
it home with a long pole. This is the
dinner of all naughty, sulky crocodiles,
and, after having it served in this fashion
regularly four or five times, the victim
gives up sulking as a bad job. He will
have to swallow it, one way or another,
he argues within himself, and in that case
he may as well take it without being tied
up, and sat upon, and insulted generally;
besides which, he may as well enjoy the
flavour as swallow all those eatables without
tasting them. Whereupon he reforms and
becomes a respectable crocodile, taking
regular meals, and is in time promoted to
the Zoological Gardens, or a respectable
menagerie.</p>

<p>This and other things we see, and we
have it explained how dangerous animals
are transferred from cases to permanent
cages, and back again. To transfer a
savage panther or tiger from a case to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">436</a></span>
cage is not difficult. Certain of the bars of
the cage are raised, the case is put opposite
the opening, and the side removed. Seeing
an opening the captive jumps at it, and the
bars are at once shut down. But to tempt
him back again into a case, when he has
become to some extent accustomed to his
quarters, is not always so easy a thing.
Carefully baiting the case with food usually
has its effect, if circumstances permit waiting;
but, if not, recourse has to be had to
smoke. A little damp straw thrust between
the bars and lighted soon makes the lair
uncomfortable, and then ensues a scene.
Eyes gleam, and teeth gnash from obscure
corners, and presently, with a bound and a
yell, the powerful beast dashes through the
opening into the case, and is secured. It
may be easily understood that any little
clumsiness or mistake at the critical moment
might lead to the case being overturned in
the rush, or improperly closed. Then, with
a tiger or black panther worked to the
highest pitch of frenzy by the fire and
smoke, some lively adventures would
probably take place.</p>

<p>And so we reach the door into Britten's-court,

with its dock labourers, its
sailors' boarding-houses, and its slop-shops.</p>

</div>
<p class="a">T that time my aunt Herminie,
fatherless and motherless,
was living in the old
abbey of Mauvoisin, near Corbeil,
which was disaffected
and had become very national.
It was during the Reign of Terror, and she
was nearly twenty years old. She was there
with two old ladies, Madame Mar&#233;chal and
Madame Badouillet: the former tall and
thin, the latter little, stout, and one-eyed.
One evening&mdash;but it will be better to let
Aunt Herminie tell the tale herself. I fancy
I can hear her now, relating this story which
excited me so, the story which I was continually
asking her to repeat.</p>

<p>The story? You wish me to repeat it
once more, my child? Well, it was in
<i>those</i> days. That evening we were sitting
by the fire: Madame Mar&#233;chal and I were
chatting, Madame Badouillet had fallen
asleep. It was about ten o'clock; outside
it was very windy&mdash;blowing hard. Oh! I
remember it well. Suddenly, there came a
knock at the door.</p>

<p>I must tell you first of all that a troop of
soldiers, about a hundred, had arrived
during the day. The officer in command,
a big red-headed fellow, had shown us a
paper, an order to billet them. They had
taken up their quarters in the chapel, and
had passed the day there, eating, drinking,
singing, and playing cards. They made a
dreadful din. They all calmed down when
evening came, and were all sleeping in
groups.</p>

<p>You will understand, little one, that it
was not very reassuring for three lone
women to be near such people. Madame
Mar&#233;chal's husband was away, Madame
Badouillet was a widow, and I an orphan;
so we bolted ourselves in the little room on
the ground floor which was situated between
the high road and the chapel, and that's
where we were when the knock came, as I
have just told you.</p>

<p>Madame Badouillet woke up with a jump,
and we all three looked straight at each
other with frightened eyes. A moment
passed and there was another knock&mdash;louder
this time. We had a good mind to sham
deafness, as you may imagine, but joking
was dangerous in those days. If you refused
hospitality to patriots, you were regarded
as a "suspect," as they called it, and
then&mdash;the guillotine! It was all over with
you in no time.</p>

<p>Madame Mar&#233;chal began to recite her
prayers; Madame Badouillet shook in every
limb; besides, I was the youngest, so I
ought to open the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">438</a></span></p>

<p>I found some men at the door, with large
hats, making quite a black group on the
road-way. They looked harassed, and their
boots were covered with dust. My first impulse
was to shut the door in their faces, but
one of them made a step forward, stretched
out his hand, and said in a low, shaking
voice:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Shelter, citoyenne, give us shelter for
the night. We are dropping with fatigue&mdash;have
pity upon us!" And these last words
were repeated
in a murmur
by the group
of men.</p>

<p>"Who are
you?"</p>

<p>"Fugitives&mdash;deputies
of the
Gironde&mdash;we
are pursued,
save us!"</p>

<p>They were
Girondins! You
will know one
day, my child,
what that
meant. It is
enough now for
you to know
that they were
poor fellows flying
from Paris,
pursued by the
Montagnards,
that is, by their
enemies.</p>

<p>"Wretched
men," I replied,
"go away! The
chapel is full of
soldiers. If you
come in you are
lost!"</p>

<p>They hesitated
a moment;
then a
pale young man,
quite a youth,
who was leaning upon the arms of two of
his comrades, murmured feebly:</p>

<p>"Walk again! I cannot go a step farther.
Go on, comrades; save yourselves and leave
me here. I prefer to die!"</p>

<p>They were brave fellows, those Girondins.
They would not hear of abandoning the
poor young fellow.</p>

<p>"Is there no other place but the chapel
where we could rest for two hours&mdash;just for
two hours only?" asked the one who had
already spoken to me.</p>

<p>"None but this room," I answered, standing
a little aside; "and the chapel has no
way out but that door (I pointed to the
middle door), so the soldiers pass through
here to enter or go out. Let them see you,
and you are lost!"</p>

<p>Great dejection was apparent in the face
of the poor man. I could see it plainly,
for it was a clear night and as light as day.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/scan438.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">"HAVE PITY UPON US!"</p></div>
</div>

<p>"Adieu, citoyennes," he said simply.
"The district is full of people who are pursuing
us. Pray that we may escape them!"
Then, turning to his companions, he said in
a low voice, "Onward!"</p>

<p>Well, my child, I was quite upset; my
heart was rent at the sight of their distress.
I understood all that they had suffered, and
all they would yet suffer. I looked at their
drooping shoulders, at their bruised feet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">439</a></span>
Certainly, by sending them away I was
shielding us three from danger, because in
helping them I was making myself their
accomplice, and exposing myself and my
companions to severe punishment. Yes, I
understood all that, but pity conquered
prudence; a kind of fever seized me, and
just as they were moving away&mdash;</p>

<p>"Listen," I whispered to them; "there
might perhaps be a way to help you, but it
would be very risky, very daring."</p>

<p>They drew near eagerly, anxiously, with
heads bent forward. Behind me I could
hear the trembling voices of Madame
Badouillet and Madame Mar&#233;chal as they
whispered to each other, "What is she
talking about? What is she saying?"
But that mattered little to me.</p>

<p>"At the other end of the chapel, above
the altar," I continued, "there is a granary
for storing fodder. Once there, you would
be all right, but to get there&mdash;&mdash;."</p>

<p>"Speak, speak!"</p>

<p>"You would have to follow a narrow
passage, a sort of overhanging cornice, the
whole length of the wall&mdash;and just over
the sleeping soldiers. If they hear the least
noise, should one of them wake up&mdash;&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"Who will lead us?"</p>

<p>"I will!"</p>

<p>I have already told you, my child, that I
was in a fever, that I was no longer master
of myself; I was acting as if in a dream.
To save them had become my sole aim.
They took counsel briefly among themselves,
while Madame Badouillet continually
pulled at my skirts and called me mad.
Oh! I remember it all as if I were going
through it now!</p>

<p>"Thanks, citoyenne, for your devotion.
We will accept the offer!"</p>

<p>I left the door and they entered noiselessly,
on tip-toe. There were about a
dozen; their clothes were torn and their
fatigue was extreme. I told my two companions
to keep watch at the door of the
chapel, and turned at once to the fugitives.</p>

<p>"You see those steps leading to the
ledge?" I asked them. "Well, I am going
to ascend them. When I reach the top I
will open the door and look into the interior
of the chapel, and if the moment is favourable
I will give you a sign. You will then
ascend and follow me along the wall to the
granary. Once there&mdash;if God allows us to
get there!&mdash;you will rest yourselves. I will
come to you when the soldiers are gone&mdash;they
ought to leave at daybreak. You
understand?"</p>

<p>All this was uttered rapidly in a low
voice; then, positively, I felt as if I were
lifted from the ground, as if impelled by
some superior will. I felt deep commiseration
for these men, unknown to me only a
few minutes before; I felt a protecting
sentiment towards them which elated me.
To save them I would have thrown myself
in front of the cannon's mouth, or have
rushed upon the bayonet's point. And I,
mite that I was, seemed suddenly endowed
with extraordinary strength and energy.
Madame Badouillet was right, I was positively
mad.</p>

<p>I mounted the stairs, opened the door
just a little, and looked in. The soldiers
were asleep in groups, their heads resting
on their knapsacks, their forms making
dark spots on the white stones of the
chapel. Occasionally one would turn over
with a grunt. A slight murmur of breathing
came from this human mass. In the
corners the guns were stacked; outside, the
wind howled in fury. A ray of light from
the moon shone through a side window,
lighting up one side of the nave, while the
other side&mdash;luckily, the side where the
ledge was&mdash;remained quite dark. To get
to the door of the granary&mdash;dimly visible,
like a dark spot, along the narrow ledge,
along the wall at about twenty feet from
the sleepers&mdash;would be the work of a few
seconds in reality, yet these few seconds
would seem an age.</p>

<p>And now came the reaction; the excitement
of the first few minutes was over, and
a dreadful feeling of depression came over
me as I saw myself face to face with the
reality, and understood the almost childish
temerity of my plan. I was seized with a
mad desire to tell the Girondins that it
was impossible to do it; that the soldiers
were waking up; that they must fly at
once. Then I became ashamed of my
cowardice, and, turning towards the men
who were watching me from below with
uneasy glances, I gave the sign to ascend.</p>

<p>They obeyed, and the first one was soon
by my side. I made a sign to keep silence&mdash;as
if they needed it, poor men!&mdash;then I
stepped upon the ledge.</p>

<p>What a journey it was! I shall never
forget it. I can feel myself now, moving
forward on tip-toe, my left hand lightly
touching the cold wall, my right hand in
space, fearing every instant to lose my
balance, or to knock against some stone,
some little heap of dirt and pieces of wall,
the falling of which would have roused the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">440</a></span>
soldiers who were sleeping below, so close
to us. And behind me I can still feel the
dumb presence of those creatures who were
following me, risking their life with mine.
We glided along the ledge like a troop of
sleep-walkers, holding our breath, treading
with extraordinary carefulness, the eyes of
each one fixed upon the one who preceded
him, all making with beating hearts for
that little door which grew larger as we
approached it&mdash;and it was I who was leading
them!</p>

<p>Having reached this exciting point, Aunt
Ninie stopped and looked at me to judge
the effect. She ought to have been pleased,
for I was sitting on the edge of my chair,
my eyes out of my head, with open mouth,
listening with never-failing interest to a
story which I had heard so many times.
"What then?" I asked.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/scan440.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">"WE GLIDED ALONG THE LEDGE."</p></div>
</div>

<p>At length, after a few minutes, terribly
long minutes they seemed, I reached the
goal. I seized the key which was still in
the door, turned it, pushed the door&mdash;and
then I thought we were lost!</p>

<p>Nobody had had occasion to go to the
granary for a long time,
so that the hinges had
become rusty; and as I
pushed it open it gave
out a creaking sound,
which went all over the
chapel, and sent an icy
chill through me.</p>

<p>"What's the matter up
there?" growled a soldier,
with an oath.</p>

<p>I stood up straight, all
of a shake, and I perceived
the fugitives, pale,
motionless, and standing
as closely as possible to
the wall. It seemed as if
our last hour had come.
Luckily, it was very windy,
as I have said, and at that
very instant a strong gust
shook the roof of the
chapel.</p>

<p>"Go to sleep, and rest
easy, you great fool! It's
the wind!" answered
another voice.</p>

<p>The first soldier listened
again for a brief space,
then stretched himself,
and went to sleep. We
were saved&mdash;at least for
the moment.</p>

<p>The door was only half
open, but it was enough
to enable us to squeeze in.
This I did when silence
was completely restored
below, and the others followed one
by one, easily enough generally, without
being obliged to open the door any further.
This was very important, for another creak
would certainly have done for us.</p>

<p>You cannot imagine the joy and gratitude
of those men when once they were all
gathered in the granary. They wept, went
down on their knees, and kissed the hem of
my dress. One would have thought that
I had finally saved them; but, alas!
the danger was still there, terrible and
threatening.</p>

<p>"Rest," I said to them; "stretch yourselves
upon the straw. Here you are fairly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">441</a></span>
safe&mdash;for the time being, at least. As soon
as they are gone you will have nothing
more to fear, and you can go away in your
turn. Now rest yourselves and sleep, and
count on me if any new danger menaces
you."</p>

<p>I left them and passed through the door,
leaving it as it was. Of course it would
have been better to shut it, but that was
impossible on account of the noise it would
have made.</p>

<p>My return journey along the ledge was
performed without incident. Alone, I felt
lighter, more skilful, and slipped along like
a mouse. At the end of a few seconds I
was back in the room, where the two ladies
anxiously awaited me.</p>

<p>Each one received me in a different way.
Madame Mar&#233;chal, severe and sharp, reproached
me cruelly, saying that <i>that</i> was
not the way to behave: it was risking my
life and theirs&mdash;that I ought to have left
them outside&mdash;that I was a fool, &amp;c. Madame
Badouillet, on the contrary, approved
what I had done, and defended me, saying
that nobody could reject the prayer of the
fugitives&mdash;it would have been infamous.
And this good woman pressed me to her
heart, and, pleased to see me back again,
kissed me, while she wiped away the tears
from her one eye.</p>

<p>So we sat down again, commenting in a
low voice upon the unforeseen and terrible
events which had come upon our hitherto
peaceful existence. And it was really a
dreadful situation. All these men, enemies,
so near to each other; what might happen
if the fugitives were discovered! It was
frightful, so much so that Madame Mar&#233;chal
proposed that we should run away, out in
the night, across the fields to Corbeil,
leaving the men to settle matters amongst
themselves as best they could&mdash;that was
her expression. Madame Badouillet and I
rejected this proposal with indignation, and
we remained there whispering to each other,
and longed for the end of this interminable
night.</p>

<p>The first streaks of dawn began to appear,
and we felt within reach of the moment
when our anxiety would end. Suddenly
we heard the gallop of horses on the road-way.
What now? We listened. The
horses stopped, and we heard a noise of
voices. Everybody seemed to be paying
us a visit that night.</p>

<p>Then came a knock as before; and, as
before, it was I who opened the
door. There was a man before
me, surrounded by several hussars
who had dismounted.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/scan441.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">"IT WAS I WHO OPENED THE DOOR."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"They are here, eh, citoyenne?" asked
the man, who was not a soldier, but doubtless
some Government agent. He was stout,
and appeared out of breath through having
come so rapidly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">442</a></span></p>

<p>I started, but soon recovered my <i>sang-froid</i>.
"Here! Who?"</p>

<p>"You know well enough. Those rascally
Girondins!"</p>

<p>"There is nobody here but the soldiers
who arrived yesterday, as you probably
know."</p>

<p>"That's what we intend to find out."</p>

<p>He motioned to one of the men to hold
his horse, and dismounted
painfully,
giving a grunt of
satisfaction when he
reached the ground.
He was certainly not
accustomed to that
sort of exercise. He
was attired in black,
with big boots, and
feathers in his hat.
His round, white face
seemed good-natured
at first sight, but the
look of his little
sunken eyes was false
and cruel.</p>

<p>He entered, followed
by two hussars,
and went straight
towards the chapel.
As soon as he was
perceived, there was
a great stir; the mass
of soldiers began to
move with a noise
of swords and guns
upon the stones, and
everybody was soon
on foot. The officer
in charge came forward
and saluted the new-comer, and we
understood that this fat man was an important
personage.</p>

<p>A conversation in a low voice took place
between them. Standing near the door,
we tried our hardest to hear what was said,
but in vain; we could only guess from the
gestures that the agent was interrogating
the captain, and that the latter was replying
in the negative. We feared to see them
raise their heads and perceive the half-opened
door above. This little door seemed
enormous now, as if everybody must see it.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/scan442.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">"A CONVERSATION TOOK PLACE BETWEEN THEM."</p></div>
</div>

<p>However, it was not so, for the agent,
finishing his conversation with the captain,
came up to me, and with that cunning look
which boded no good, he said, "So you are
quite sure, citoyenne, that there is nobody
here but these men?"</p>

<p>He pointed to the soldiers, who were
about to brush themselves and put themselves
in order. I looked him in the face
and replied, "Nobody!"</p>

<p>He put that same question to Madame
Badouillet, who bravely made the same
reply. Then it was Madame Mar&#233;chal's
turn. I thought she was going to betray
us, and I gave her a fierce look. She
hesitated a moment;
then, with her eyes
on the ground, she
stammered, "I do not
know&mdash;I have been
asleep&mdash;I have heard
nothing."</p>

<p>"Well, <i>I</i> know
more about it than
<i>you</i>," said the agent.
"Some peasants have
assured me that the
Girondins came in
here, that they have
passed the night here,
and that they are here
still. Is it true?"</p>

<p>We all were silent.</p>

<p>"Now just think
well about it, citoyennes.
You know
what you are exposing
yourselves
to by hiding these
traitors?"</p>

<p>It was terrifying to
be thus questioned in
the midst of men
who were watching
us closely, and whose
looks seemed to
pierce our very souls. I felt that Madame
Mar&#233;chal was giving way, that all was lost.
Her lips moved, she was about to speak.
I did not give her the time to do so, and
putting a bold face on the matter, I replied:</p>

<p>"Since you doubt us, citoyen, search the
place. I will lead you wherever you like."</p>

<p>He hesitated, thrown off the scent by my
effrontery, and I thought he was going to
give up all idea of pursuit, when a voice
cried, "It is my opinion that if any little
plot has been contrived, it has been done up
there."</p>

<p>A soldier, doubtless the one who had
woke up in the night, pointed with an evil
look to the ledge and the granary door. All
eyes were raised, and my legs trembled
under me. I thought of the unfortunate
men who were behind that door, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">443</a></span>
weapons, without any possible means of
defence, listening to what was said. I
cursed myself for having yielded to their
prayer, and having sheltered them. Outside
they would have been in just as great
danger, but it would not have been my
fault. They could have fought, run away,
anything; but there they were through my
fault! It was horrible, and I thought I
should go mad.</p>

<p>After questioning the soldier&mdash;oh, I could
have killed him, the wretch!&mdash;the agent
turned towards me.</p>

<p>"Well, citoyenne, as you propose it, you
shall act as our guide. Lead us to that door
up there; it's a granary, I suppose?"</p>

<p>I nodded. I could not speak, my throat
was too dry.</p>

<p>"A few men follow
me! On!"</p>

<p>That was a most
terrible moment,
my child. I had to
summon all my
strength to keep
from swooning. I
drew myself up,
however, and went
towards the stair-case
which led to
the ledge, that stair-case
which I had
ascended with the
fugitives a few hours
before. The agent
came next, then the
captain and several
soldiers.</p>

<p>What could I
hope for in obeying
the order? It would
require a miracle to
save the Girondins.
But I had fought it
out to that point,
and I would fight it
out to the end. And,
frankly speaking, I
scarcely knew what
I was doing, I was
acting unconsciously&mdash;I
had been told to
go there, and I was
going, that's all!</p>

<p>I soon reached the
ledge, the agent following
painfully on
account of his corpulence.
He seemed,
moreover, very clumsy, and his fat body
embarrassed him much. When he reached
the top of the staircase and saw the ledge,
on which I had already advanced a step or
two, he hesitated.</p>

<p>"Oh! oh! it is very narrow!" he murmured.</p>

<p>Then he saw that all the soldiers were
looking at him from below, and, stung by
their looks, he followed me slowly, supporting
himself against the wall, stepping
with infinite caution. Really, if the situation
had not been so dreadful it would have
been grotesque.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/scan443.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">"LOOK! SPIDERS WEBS!"</p></div>
</div>

<p>Two questions swam in my head. What
should I do? Should I run rapidly forward
and join the unfortunate men and
die with them? Or should I throw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">444</a></span>
myself down on the stones and kill myself?</p>

<p>Still, I went on slowly, slowly, expecting
every minute to see the door shut by the
poor fellows as a frail and useless obstacle
to a certain capture; and I was so interested
in their fate that I forgot my own
danger.</p>

<p>We had reached the centre of the ledge
when suddenly the agent stopped, and,
turning towards those who followed, said:
"Look! spiders' webs!" and he pointed to
the entrance of the granary.</p>

<p>And, in fact, by a providential chance, a
large spider's web, torn when I opened
the door, had remained hanging on the
woodwork; and the insect had, during the
few hours of the night, partly repaired the
damage. The fresh threads crossed the
whole space of the opening, and nobody
could imagine for a moment that men
had passed through that space that very
night without breaking the whole of the
web. Yes, my child, a spider, a simple
spider, had done it.
But one cannot
help thinking that
the good God had
something to do with
it.</p>

<p>"It is useless to go
further," said the
agent.</p>

<p>Between you and
me I believe the fat
fellow was not sorry
at heart, for he was
dreadfully afraid of
rolling down below, and pride alone had
sustained him.</p>

<p>There is little need to say more. The Girondins were saved, and I
with them. The agent went off, followed by his hussars; and the other
soldiers marched away soon afterwards.</p>

<p>As soon as the chapel was empty I ran to the granary. It is not
necessary to tell you with what protestations of gratitude I was
received. One second more, and, as I had expected, they would have
shut the door, which would have been fatal; but Providence willed it
otherwise.</p>

<p>We gave them something to eat, and they remained all the day with
us; for it would have been imprudent to have left before night. When
night came they left us, after having thanked me much more than I
deserved. I had done my duty&mdash;nothing more.</p>

<p>We followed them with our eyes upon the road as long as we could.
Then they disappeared in the darkness.</p>

<p>Did they escape? Were they discovered, and killed on their way? I
have never heard. But I have rejoiced all my life that I, delicate as
I am, was able to go through so much without breaking down. Madame
Badouillet and Madame Mar&#233;chal were both ill afterwards.</p>

<p>And that is my story.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
